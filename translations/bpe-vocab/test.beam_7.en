Take a couple of years ago, here at TEDstage here at TEDstage of Kingdom. Christian design issue called the Human named in the hand.
And the idea is quite simple.
Take the shot of four has to build some of you have to build the road.
Helsewhere, you know, you have to stay at the top of it.
And it turns out, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that this is really great, because the force of the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And at that point, I have almost 70 strength of the shaming of designing around the world with my students and designing and designing and design architecture, and designing architecture and architecture. And this is a 50-handed and something in this shock and something in this hand, and something in this slightly in the room, and something like this is about nature, and you look at the right-hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: Yeah. She's shocket about it, he imagines how it will show you how it would look at the seem of the board, and then they spend a lot of the planet.
She's gone. And it goes on and throw up and throw it up to the bread.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at this point.
And there is a number of people who have a lot of the momentous momentum of "Christ."
They are mindfulfilled in the room, and they lose their footprint, and it makes her fingertips.
You see, of course, there are some of the other side that they have a lot more structure of structure. You know, "Look at the best, and they are the best, and they're produced by the best, and you get the best.
And it's pretty amazing.
As you tell us thus then. You know, it's not only the profound out the other struck structure, but also the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know?
And he would like to say, "You know, I love to say, "Look at the bottom of one of the kidn't.
And you don't lose the time of fight by the way.
But there is another reason.
This is that the students are training are training to cover the same.
And it turns out it out.
And what happens is that, when you put it on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fish, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they start with the gang, and they start with the window, and you build the bonds of the bonds of the hands of the paper stunk steak step, and so they have some more shock and so they have more shooting and so they have more gone. And so they have more gone.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have an answer to the point of course of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the average, the average is about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is this? Because they understand them? Because they understand the triangle of the dung and the patterns and patterns and patterns of the geek step. It's the kind of struck structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of structure.
So, the direction of this.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add the teams of the teams of a man from the hands of the dancing is the result of the speech of hand.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner dinner. And why is it like this?
Because they have the strength of this.
I mean, I'm going to take the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Comming.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have this structure.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, okay, you know, let's go to Christians.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my student?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. It doesn't build something that was not built something that was going to stand in the leg.
If a bit of a team would be built, to say, you know, a structure structure of three Christian structure of three days, it would be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of the big impacts have a strong?
I reached the breakfast of it.
What does it happen?
You know, I mean, they have learned the value of the process.
And the same way. And the same equipment has gone from the worst of the bottom of the best result.
They have covered the road, the other struck struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you might ask: Why could you lose anybody and you lose the problem of somebody writing this stuff?
And the reasoning is, I held creeping the device of the digital hands and the process of useful and process of using the shape of the shape of what you are building and games and games and games and games and play visually effects and the visual effects and the visual effects and effects visual.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has their own, right?
This challenge.
And so, you know, this is the value of this experience.
And for the one of the other hand, you can get access to the wisdom of the wild of the bread. This is the same. This is the kind of duting strength. It's a blogging block where you can see how to build you see how to build.
They are also the struck struck with the strength.
There are also some example.
You can look at the record and record.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that designer is really an athletes.
We're going to be able to break the strength of the sample of all the feelings of what we have, and to apply what we have better thinkings, and the factories, and the factory of the challenge.
And it turns out, you know, a little bit like this.
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's look at the point of view we have a machine. We have a car, a machine, a car.
And everybody elsewhere in this room, you see in this room, you have to go through it.
You can go back or never go back and forth, but you can't remain is where you are.
And I wonder what you're going to do with you choose, you know, I put my friendshift in this question in the last slide of this question, and all they wanted to be.
I don't know. She's going to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other side of the Ice or "I" or "Christ."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I do not part of this group.
I don't want to go back. And I don't want to be.
So, I want you to look at this point in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this planet, you look at the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, beside and the stage.
It doesn't exist.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I divided before I was going to get 6.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my hand, my parents are close to the sees of 8,000.
So it would be good to exist. It's a nuts at the beginning of the speech that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
Good dunes like this. This is an incredible phenomenon. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
Very the way.
And it turns out that the philosophical data.
No.
I have gone.
In the rich world of samples that threatens that threatening millions of people with just a generation.
DH: Hellof, beside bread.
You know what?
Very the way.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
Unfortunately, there is no longer and there are no more and more and more problems, because there are other people's issues of many times, one of them and one of them is that weird, a billions, a billionth of humans and you look at the bottom every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
Helsewhere, you know, you can be.
If we are not inventing a little bit of a way to come up with this one.
So this is the question: Can we do this: Can we do this? I think yet.
I think it's obviously, that we can produce food that we can produce foot that we can eat the bottom of bills of billions of the earth of the ground.
And I think we can run this world with this world with energy that will not destroy it.
I really think that and it's not just a lot.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wandering with the night -- one of the things that I don't leave me with it.
I never had a bigger progress that you need a lot of progress than now and we haven't been able to use it in the situation of the way to use it in the way that we can do today.
We are in the same.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should come back, for three hundred years ago, before the Icelcelcelebrate Imagine Christmas lights, to discover it in order to discover it in which we fight for these things that we fight on the streets, all of these things with more front.
People are gone.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
All of the world has right. The world is about the opposite of this.
You don't have speech at the bottom of your own step.
And it took me something like this.
A hundred years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines about the vaccines for "The New York" for "The New York City.
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did to do with him, so I did what I do is use.
Scidence after these days, I wrote a article about a piece of paper dose.
Think about it as well. And the same thing as it is just more important.
People were going to be.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and this is what I could not be able to understand dancing about what people believed in the hand.
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, they do what I'm doing.
I mean, I'm a little bit of a dyname; you look at today; you look at the bottom of the girlfrighten, and all of the step.
But these articles. They were meeting and I can't see my damn and you realize which, I realized which, I understand.
She was because she was sick, she was showing my hands that I go out of my mindships, there were no girl.
They were boring people with my granddaughter, you know, the girl,
They were just like the people in this room in this room.
And I guess my bread.
But then I was thinking.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
RB: Yeah. Think about he is about his fingertips.
Take the same. We are about it in the terms. You see it in the same. You can put it between the glass. You see it on the street.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We were gone. I have lost the conference in the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes even in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall of the same. You can see a few names and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. She's gone.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you get the question, "Look at the bottom of the girl, you can see the damn and probe.
You don't take anything to go.
But here's what this idea.
And I can say that, because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
An 12 years ago, he was published an article in the room, one of the same, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines in the room, and vaccines against the bottom of the river and the right-handed articles.
Thank you.
And they don't. They don't.
I really needed to be doing the sample of the smoke. Helloa; it's an important issue of this.
They came up and the results.
RB: You see, there are some of the United States in the United States of the United States of Britain, in South Britain, in South Cancer and all said to me the same paper and all of the same paper and all of the same thing: There is no climbing cool, there is no cloud, absolutely no line.
I don't think about it.
We don't think a whole bunch of documentary damn documents from a work from a functioning of a little bit of a little bit of data that off.
But you know?
RB: You know, the girl, the girls have been disappearing and here is what the United States and here's what the United States, the United States is one of the world in the world in the world, which is a little bit of vaccines in the world in which routine.
This is the same. Helf. It should be.
It's great.
What did we come up with here?
You know, I mean, you know, you really understand.
Does anybody here on the bottom of the bottly?
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It doesn't really happen.
In this summer doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen, but it happened to 1,000,000,000.
A lot of a bunch of birds because of the bridge, 20 dollars, 20 cases, 20 cases, 20 cases on the top.
But, because here was not going to happen, we can't think about this and people like J.C. . jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance Law and ignorance.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we have to teach that we have to learn how to be.
And this guy, Jewish. Her St. Tok, he was a window.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Today, no framework, no aggressive, the policy of dying.
Take it out of the left-hand.
His name name name is Pay.
Take a little bit of what we developed a vaccine with a cockroaches against a wheel.
She's gone.
All right, right?
This is the go, just that Paul talk's talks about it in the vacuum and how these are the pregnant, and how people should slow and that people should just slow.
And this is what they do.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. When you talk about it in a audience in the audience, you can't fall of the snake, it can't be protected by the way.
It's called "Cloud because people like people like to say that I know what my children are going to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the board.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse and more worse and in the same, the children are going to die. It's just because of it is just a statistic.
And they're not going to die.
How do you stay with the poll. She's gone.
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fairly fair, and he told me that you can see that I'm kind of a bunch of me.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have any gone. And he doesn't have to look at the baby against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen.
But everyday I don't know. You know, a guy can go on the side of the morning in the morning in a planet.
Very the way.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend us by doing it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
Take the Chinese same, a little antique antify of oxygen to work.
You know, I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
There are these things and these things and you go to your medicine with the alternative.
It looks like all the same thing.
You know, I'm going to take a little bit of the same.
It's okay, you know, you want to pay attention to 1,000-billions of dollars for it.
Next.
Look at the bottom of the shape of the ship. She's going to be.
Why do we do this?
I think that I understand -- you know, the snake, and I think of the girlfrightens of the girls.
Look at the bottom of the beginning. We don't have it.
And I should not have to have it.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so flowing around. And so you can be.
RB: You see it in the arts of the same.
It's fantastic.
But, in fact, it's a very seriously, because these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all kinds of objects.
Next. It is one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, humans and you say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point?
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't know how to stand if the secret of the state of the state of the Western Spanish. Helf. This is the one that says, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point, you know, she says, "Look showing it up in the hands of the glasses of the magness." And it's like to look at the strength of the shock and it's a slightly like to look at the show.
When you go on the road, you go on the road, and the saming and the map and the sample of the shoes and the strength of the strength in in a place where you want, you know, you're going to be able to see.
You can go to the point in South Africa in South Africa's South Africa.
He killed 1,000-and-a-thousand thousand-and-and-and-speech glasses that judge. Helf. Helsewhere, there are much more efficient in the hands are more efficient than the medicine are more efficient than drug drugs that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
She's about thousands of decades of thousands of decades.
Please. You don't, you know, I don't tell you that there is no consequence.
There are here.
This is the lack of the same.
It's a controver.
It's a controver.
This is the idea, it's not science.
I mean, I have the hands of my hand, every task.
In the garden. She's gone.
And no fish.
There are no hands of Christians.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Something was okay, everybody, otherwise.
I got down the road.
Now we can do it in a different way.
Of course, there is a little bit of a changed.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the waste, and that can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
You don't want to do this?
I have to be married. I mean, I don't understand.
That's what we do. We are testing against the bottom of the modify of genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be.
We don't want to be.
You know what I do you know is the answer to all this?
Yes, you have here.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is nowhere there is nothing to do with the science.
It's the legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
It's a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work.
In the next 50-year-olds will be going to have to be able to stand 70 percent more food.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't know.
Why? Why? Wow, you know, it's very difficult to change.
We don't want them to be. We don't want to eat people to eat the bottom of the same.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a chart.
Take the same.
Next.
And then people will be able to eat him.
Will not suffering, you know, and you know?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go?
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it like this: Why do we have.
Because we don't want to change.
It's just about change.
It's not about our strength of our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know, you know?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We're not able to describe something like this.
It's all the way -- you know, this is shame, it is under our level and even we have to slowly slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, you know, incredibly destroyed, you can say, "Look, you can say, "Look at this point in this book, you want to go out in this book, you know, you see the stunk of the day?"
Helf. She's going to be here.
Now, this is what you do is like the step, but we have a step, but we have an opportunity but we have an opportunity.
We can program. We can program.
We can move it to the strength of it.
We need to have. We need these discussions and we have to think of this. We have to think about it.
I know that we can also see that we can see in my hand, I just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You see, in one day of the damage of Steve.
And it was a man to be a human, an Africans.
And I tell you a whole story that many of you have written a lot of the articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, and then he made a film, with the R&amp;D. H: Helf like Steve [unclear], like Steve [unclear], and Jam], and Jamdly Jamn and Jamames like Dathick, and Jamn and James Dathick,
Next. Today's breakfast of dance.
Thank you very much like to look at the bottom of the dancing of Steve. His to see speech or see the film and you can see the stunk of these two people, but you know, the other two people, but how the muscles of these two people, but how he does it helps with these two people, and then it was an instrumental strength of these two people, and then it was on the other hand, and then it was a little bit of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of these. e. e. e.
And I met my dung on the stage.
Take a little bit of listening to the same.
Very whatsoek in a very game in a very playful way.
I used to talk about the music. I was an email. I got an email. I got a couple of days later after he said, "No."
Now, I have to mention that Next.
But, as a result now, it's pregnant to these wise.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of them as he explaining it as he explain it as he explaining a lot of the shock in the streets, and you look at the streets in the streets in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkill of those juggling with the strength of the slightly in the hands of the show.
And Next.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the shock and girl, and if someone stopping him.
And I was frankly, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started singing.
And I singing the first part of the concert of the concert of his life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech yet.
It was like how it was the influence.
And the same.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see his own step, and he stood up with his own living, and she started playing on the side, some of the glasses of the concert of the concert of the concern that rights, some of my hands on my hands me to judged the ripppled me on my shouldn’t gone on my hand, and you can look at the other hand.
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Buddhist at Being Christian.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You see the same.
And while I was on the bottom of the picture, I was talking about. I mean, this is the human being. It turned out of a part.
It's like this.
And for Net.
Because the music allows it allows to take their own thinkings, and you know, and it turns out to the stroke, and you can get them through the images and creativity, and the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. And this is an event from the strength of the suffering.
And I understand. And I understood that this is the same.
This is the reason why we do the music we do the museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and with our brains, and with our artists, with our artistic shape of these emotions, and we have these emotions, and we are these emotions in the reality.
And the reality of the bottom of the extending us to all of us, and you get us out of it.
And for Net.
You can finish the release of the muscle of the muscle of him, and you go back in a family.
I will always be doing the music with Net.
Thank you.
Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the GD.
RB: You can see the same.
So, please.
I am Jessons of Yes. I'm going to be. I'm an end. I'm an designer. I'm an design.
I think about the game.
And my purpose for the next to the next decade is to try to the point of the world in the rescue of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for that, and it involves to build more world, including the world, including the present of the pressure of the present here to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
Over the point of view, we are three billion hours per week on the week of the shot showing us the step.
One of the things that you might be thinking. It's very much time of you can think about the game.
Maybe too much of the time, it helps you see how how many problems we have to solve it in the real world, we have to solve the real world.
Together, it consistent, confidence research.
Take billions of hours on his hands on the bottom of the hands of the game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers too.
So, this is probably a little bit of contrary.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it with it.
If we want to solve the problem, we want to be.
This is why. This picture of what I think is going to do with what I think is that playing the games are so essentially the steps are so criticizing for the next slightly the next slightly of the other hand.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a photograph called the Play of Day.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot in front of you in front of the today's play.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you're not a game. You can lose to lose a part of not a part of this photograph of this picture.
And it turns out that nobody notice that you neither new, you know, "Look at the bottom of the girl, but focused on the hand, you know, your emotion is a strong, and you look at the bottom of a very difficult issue for a very difficult problems.
If you are a today's son, you will see a couple of fingertips some of the floods like this.
And the same.
This is a game.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A window. It's a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary of the picture, you don't believe that you haven't really believe that you cannot touch it.
It was almost beyond the bottom of the board.
And when you reach out there you are so sweating to discover that you are truly to discover that you are a joke.
This is a too.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that resolve of people who solve you around the world as we try to remote your hands as we try to remove the next century.
BF: Hello. It will be. She's going to be which, in the way to get a window.
Now on the bottom of the same, this is a face that we see more often in our life, as we see in our life expectancy.
This is what I call "Christian face, I'm not good at all.
And this is where I do this stuff, he was doing this today? Can you see? Yes. Can you look at those.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at living. I'm not good at all.
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in the box of my neighborhood of my neighborhood.
In Bero.
And this is a problem that many games you have.
Your daughters, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't refer to my grandfather as "["] ["] [unclear], even though this is a component of a little bit more in the games than in your own games than in the shape of the shock of doing something that I refer to do something that conconconfidence of doing something that conconfidence, inspiring to collapse with the other day.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us get the best version of us becoming our best version of ourselves, the most disappeared in a moment to help you see in a database, the most likely to come up with a slightly as a problem, as you need to right-hand issue issues as a little as I was going to step.
In the real life, when we're putting up in front of you.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We don't have any feeling that we don't have this feeling when we play, they are just not in the game, they are not in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I find.
What is the game of the shape of the games that make a sense of feeling that there is no matter what can we do?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and applies and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at the games of the game like the World War III. With With With the dress, which is really a cold environment.
And I started noticing a few things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the damage.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere else is that, anywhere in the hand, you know, one of these kinds of online games in the World War breads in the World War k bake, meetings, you know, a lot of personal personal character, and you know, there's a lot of character that I'm willing to be.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips in your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remove it.
But this is at the bottom of what you can be.
But there is no check in the World War II.
There is no state.
There's always something clearly clearly about it.
And also there are also a collection of this collaborative approach.
Of course, the point where you go, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you.
It's not something that may be able to easy.
And in addition to it, it's also this story, and this story, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard of Christianity in the level and pleasant at the bottom of the board, and please.
We don't receive the girls of the girlfrightening conference in real life.
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the talk, and pleasant talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, pleasant ideas.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental issues like the World War IIII. With With Wait is that it is that it's so satisfy to be on the point of won the point of won the shock of a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of all the time that we are virtual.
It's just better as reality.
Look at the same point, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World Wase of the World War III. Hello. This is 5,00000-year-olds and the virtues of right-year-olds and the virtues of the same way.
Now, this is not necessary.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'm going to put that in the context of 5: 5,000-year-old girl, three million years of our first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're talking about how much time we are playing the games of the game, the only way that meaning the sense of what it makes us think about it right now, is to talk about time in the magnitude, what this is an extraordinary, which is an extraordinary.
But it's the right way.
We have evolved by a spectrum of a little bit more collaborative and the heart.
That's true.
So, you know, you look at this statistick like this.
It was published by a recent scientist at the University of New York City.
I mean, the other side of you.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kid that you're going to spend about what you will spend in my classrooms in my classrooms and until I finally finish. You know, if you never lose from the hand.
So we have a whole by.
And some of you may probably be reading with the new damn of MGee.
So, you're going to be heard of this stuff.
It's based on the aches on the same.
We're going to be just as good as we do as well as the largest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking forward now is a whole generation of the young people.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Is it the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend at least one ordering on the other hand.
These are the girls are the game.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the future. We're going to be another billboards that are really extraordinary of the topic that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
Suddenly fall of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shipping of the shift.
This is going to bring us to 1,000-billions.
So I started to think about what I do these games are doing these games.
These are the four things that we discovered.
OK.
Of course, the point of these.
Your daughter have always credn’t believe that a little girl is possible and that I always can go on the way to try and do it now.
Fouring the girls are not stuck on the bottom of the bread.
RB: Who's experiences are experimenting at the clock of a dancing of a living.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you played us with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reasoning is that it requires a lot of trust.
We have gone.
And so, you know, playing with a game with someone with a game with someone really building with a shadows.
And as the result of this, we build social relationships, the societies.
And it turns out to the same.
You know, there is a little bit of the game that played the environment.
It's because you know what, when we played a game. You know, we are actually more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the headline, you can see or when you go away.
We know that we are optimistic optimistic that we are human being.
And the today's gone of these are willing to work and work very hard on all the time, if you lose the right work is that the right work on the right hand.
And finally, you know, the same.
All right, you know, I love to go and I love to be attacked by the mountains that inspire of the stories.
So, just a little bit of trigger to help us see the way to help us see things in the perspective.
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the ball in the world.
The second is the largest wife. Here, the largest than 8,000-year-old day-to-day articles is the World Warken.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month.
They compared to it.
They build it.
They are confused to be. You see a resource of dynamic knowledge of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the strengths and full of hope.
They are people who think there are people who are capable of the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world to change the worldwide, but not the virtue.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's an economy.
She's gone. He is the gene is gender. He studies how people investing in people investing so much time and energy in the world.
And he says, "We're talking about, we are married to what you do.
I guess it is an economy.
And he says, "You know, I am not as I -- I am a game design.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of snake, because the players can get more in the world.
They can be.
They receive the girl, and they feel better, and I feel worse worse. You see in your games than in the game.
So, he tells you now, he has a little bit like a sense of sample to spend a lot of time in the world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the shame, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world with more like a game more like a game.
And so, I traveling my hands from something that happened in something that happened about 2,500 years ago.
These are the windows of the ancient hands of the bonds of an hour.
You know, at the end of being controlled by extraordinarily controlled by the juggling of juggling.
And this is the first equivalent of the game.
And if you're gone.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's gone.
You know, it was like this. It was so a bunch of flaw in the Middle Christians decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are going to be. People are going to be.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of HToday, they have invented, they have invented the game, they have invented the games of the window and the definition and definitely definitely definitable in the room.
By a day, every day, one of them will ever.
And the next day, everyone is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the speech of speech, because the games are so sold because the games are so sold by the hands are so solving us and teach us in a product and learn how much satisfy that satisfy that satisfy hair, they will ignore the fact that they haven't done.
And so the day of the today's game.
And it turns out to be with Hi. Today, they have lived by the way, they lived 18-year-old survival.
Now, this is expensive, I believe, the way we use play.
From the daughter of the shape of the games to fall of the shape of the suffer in the real world in the real world.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfied in the road, all of our life and our lives, and our lives, our life and receiving what we need in the game, we need in the game.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
BF: BF: Buildlife spreading by 18-year-olds, after 18-year-old girlfrightening doesn't care about it.
And so, the today's decided that they would play.
They did. They have a whole bunch of gap.
They were playing a game of flood dancing, and the window, and win the window they got the chance to go in a hand.
They are going to be.
And they will go to the candle of a new place where to live.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot show, they have shown you where they have shown you a little bit of Iglglglglasses that they have the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA and the old steps of the streams.
And so, you know, researchers have the south of the Scientific story of HGee.
And the way they found out of the board, you see the glass of a global road, which was about 20 years old, and what they could be explained about 20 years old, which could be explosion.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save his shouldn'clock with the shape of the game, you can see the games of the games of the games for 18 and then you can be so inspiring and you can know how to go and know how to stand knock it through the games of the game.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing with the Western damage of the 19th of 1997.
The girl was the first game, it was the first game.
They were playing. They were playing. They have gone for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 18-year-old damage.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-and-a-billion hours of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeed by half of us to get a half of us to play a half of us to play.
Now, I know what you know you are the question: "Look how can we solve the problem of your life.
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. flaw and expression of our opposing option of how to try to talk about what we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage.
And then we want to stand you want to get people to translate this stage with this stage.
We want to stand imagining ourselves, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of the balls of those to you get these windows.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Lake of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
Helfly of ownership is gone.
And then it turns out that you are going to be a real video in the real time that you look at what it looks like.
And you need to imagine. You have to imagine how you lived in your life if you all this would be true. And then you can see you get the ridge. And then you can put it in a blog of the pictures of the pictures of the shops.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to kill their chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because that's what it is.
But if you include the rest of them in a seep, and you say, "Look and you say, "Look at this point, you know, "Look without okay."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is like to show you the boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
She's gone.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world of the world I think about the issue than the lack of own, bigger than the lack of own.
This is how I created a game called Sure.
And the precision of it. It was a super-computer.
Suppose the computer. It's called the Cloud of the GD. H: High gh Skkkkke.
So I have a little bit of the people to come up with almost in an online movies like in Jesus Bring. Helf.
You know, you see the movies of Jamary Christian Christian Chridddge, it shape, it shapes a little bit of your dreams.
You look at the astronomy of these, the strength of science.
But in our game.
Today, I had 80,000 people who have played this game.
They were invented by 500 solutions of the crazy of crazy that you can see if you can see if you go and see if you go and look like "C" and search struck structure.
So, finally finally fine, the last show, the last slide of the shadow in three mark step. This is a game. This is a game.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a lot. We have a year.
You know, I would like to invent with you all of you to share this game with you with this game with you.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are a kind of version of what we could do with a little bit of what we could do in the world.
All right, I think you will agree that you will agree with me that today's resource that we can use to human. This is that we can use to work for the real world in the real world, that games are a strong, that games are a strong.
We all have these super-powered strength of these amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of these social relationships, and this sense of optimistic lights, and this feeling of optimism and dancing and dance.
And I hope in the southern showing us that we can see us play.
And this is the hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the future, I think of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play.
So, I said, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am really interested in the except of the same.
Of course, the same way, the cloud of fingertips have a side effect, they have a measuring effect of the hands of the hands of the hands of the hand, because the person is what happens is an effect, because the person, just because the person is an effect, or something like a girl, or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
Somebody fe. It becomes a real way that someone else in a way that someone in a perception.
So to look at this point, I want to start by showing you a little bit of showing you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick, which is a trick that you can see in the book.
And I learned, I learned from Christians.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I'm going to take a little bit of the hands in the hand.
I'm going to try.
And in order to make sure that there is nothing to do in your hand, or you don't look at my hands from my hand. I will fit up here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the street in the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open your hand, and I hope that if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can break that I can slow your hand.
There is no circle or from your hand, or from the hand, without flowing around. And you can look at it.
Take it.
Helfly of the girl, you learn that on the other side of the other side of the steps of the strength, because you can travel in the road, because you can traveling a lot of about the shock of dance if it is very simple if it's very simple.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
Take the boundaries in your hand.
And I tell you that I'm going to end up with my hands to my hang my hands to my hang me that there is nothing on a living.
And it turns out that I'm concerned about the judging of the dunk is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time I think of my hands are moving on the front of you and you don't see it in the front of you and you don't see the bottom of the fingertips is going to go through a shock where it is by the kind of like this.
All right.
This is a child without a baby without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I reached my bread, my fingertips, my finger fingertips.
And we can talk about what you can look like this in the hero's own, why you don't notice that I'm not just three flag in here, because there is a light-hand side, and the way process, and the way processing information. It doesn't seem like this, two, three, two, three, two, three.
But this is not everybody.
She's gone.
And then when you look at the bottom of the smoke.
I give my hands up to a part.
RB: You know, that's what you can do with my friends and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I am reading a dancing, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock is not the doctor, so for me this is amazing.
And it turns out that if you can be.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the same.
Although no one of these pasts have no subjects, they don't subject the fish. It is the same.
But the past.
Right?
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, they're more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
One is the headline.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you -- not as good as you can. It's not as well.
But the idea is,
... Today, and two, and the boss of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effectively effectively effect. You have to go away.
DH: Helse? Of course, with something like that.
So this is an image so stronger for them, much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
This is where it is that the phase peak is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way.
And there is no way there is no quete.
You just go to the point of viewing us a network in our body, and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I can make it too.
And we know from that study, you know, if you want reality, you have to use it.
This is a hurt of bird ddamage of gap.
And I'm going to pick it up a little bit.
That's my hand.
This is the piece.
I'm going to cover the pieces of the step, and I'm going to fly with this picture.
If you are going to be.
So you suggest that if you look at that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't do the first part of the step.
You're going to look at it, you will look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gose.
It seems to be fair.
And now I'm going to go through the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
I was doing something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you look at it.
Yes, of course,
You know, I know what people think about when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud to reach out that was going to fit in each of us to the distance of us a couple of new minutes. Take a few minutes. Take a little bit.
What does it look like?
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at this point. OK.
Let me show you better.
This is the pigeon.
This is my career.
You know, I ask the same. If you are doing. If you look at the bread, you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
Think about it in the back, or those who want to look at the video of the video, the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff. It looks pretty curious stuff, but if it would be sick, you know, if you had a gone in there, if you have a hole in there, and it would be gone.
Your daughter.
You are normally normal, I would take the same.
And I would look at the bottom of my hand.
But I think that in this context and the idea of doing something like this.
We can see some of the damage of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the snake. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So, I met a bunch of dancing in my life.
I love. I just love.
The first thing was more like a bit more like a bird business.
It was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the flaw, the other standard.
So you can see you feel like when you see.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
You see, in a day, the sample of the girl, and she asked me if he asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at this point," I said.
Here's a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men.
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans and ocean.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fish of the fishing of the sea that you love. She's lottttty, and you see the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the board, you know, the bread.
That's where they have gone that they disappeared.
So as well as the strength of the board.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish fish. His fishing fish.
A lot of flaw in the same.
Take has a range of conversation with the conversation of the girl is about 15 to a 15th of 15.
That means that it takes a 15-and-and-and-blood fish.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So okay, in the end, in the end, it was a company that try to do it.
I wanted to be.
And the day I was on the other side of the shot of the speech of the speech of the girls in the audience in the company.
Helse's name. We call it D.
DH: Yeah, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point, you are Christians, because you are Christians because you are like this.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of it.
And then he adds him, "Look, we are actually a world of ourselves.
RB: You know, this is the shot of the dancing is bad?
"Look at the bests on the stage.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. Today's five to somebody?
"Look at this point.
"Look at the bottom of the board," I said.
And in that night, I was born, I was trick, I was traveled in my hand, and thinking: What nuts is a protein is a protest is a protein with you?
So the second day, even before I call, I call it the Day.
I said, "Yeah, let me show me some examples of the bringing of protey." And he said that you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the same.
Next one could not give me one answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist.
Helse's name. We call it D.
"Yeah, I go, I said, "Look, you know, you look at some of the protest of protey." Well, you know, okay.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the slight?"
He said, "Yes.
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of your hand, you know, your dam?"
You look at the point of view, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two produced.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of 30 percent.
"Yeah, what is sustaining is sustainable in the fairly in the board.
It was a shock of the girl, and he said, "Look, and he said, "It's just too many of them are too many of you in the world."
RB: You know, my breakfast for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass.
In fact, they are.
Next, I felt like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love, it's another kind of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way that you know how much you know.
Take it up to my hands up to a restaurant in the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of it.
It was kind of the kind of showing us the meeting the meeting.
He came to the mother's gone of the blue board, lighten, lighten, almost scale.
She's gone.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
While can you make a fish. It takes to be able to get the good side.
I don't, but this guy, this guy.
Helse's name. We call it Make Mik.
In fact, the name is really my name is Mount.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bike.
It's a fish.
It's at the bottom of the same.
The 19th of the 19th of the 1970s, my hands was in the hand.
They are growing. They were sitting in the area in the area that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they get rid of the water, and they get out of the road, back in the rights.
But they couldn't make it work.
And the screen of these, it was a disaster.
He killed 9/1,000-percent of the bird of the bird that place for this place that place for a lot of birds.
And so in the 1980s a Spanish.
What did they do?
They've got the same.
They come.
Instead of boring on the bottom of the bottom of the water, they used the frogs of the fish.
They've got the same.
They've created a fish. Helf.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take step. She's gone.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a great kind of same.
All right, OK?
This is what it looks like a window with the window.
Now this is what you needly nearly neat your minds of your fingertips.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group that you reminds that reminds her hand.
And I learned that Mr. She's shocking. He spent most of the book, most of the book.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "You know."
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the birds of the board, and you see the strength of the planet.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was gone.
So I wondered. I said, "Look at the bottle, "High List."
He showed up to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, philosophical stage.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation. Helsewh?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a kind of rich system, the fish system that fish. It's like what he would be eaten.
Scidence.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
And later on that day, I was running through this hands through this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look at this point, I said, "Look at a place that looks like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far." And I was like, "Look that I was will?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing spot of the best, though, though, though, thousands and thousands of birds and thousands of birds and thousands of steps on the bottom of the road, a truth -- you can see how you see the roke.
"You know, this is successful of it.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of their fish.
She's gone.
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't seem to be.
"Yes.
"Look at the same time. We are 20 produced by the bottom of the fish and of our fish and of our fish.
Well, last last year, this is the properties of 1,00000-year-olds on her houses on it, more than 2,000 species.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
He clicked up with her steps his head.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the bottom of the bottom of the same.
Please thinking. Helf. She's ganging the flaw of the plant.
So how to fly is the same, the more is the better system, the more is the better system.
All right, okay, to require this.
A farming that doesn't hurt their houses of the animals, and a farms, and a farm that they eat the same time.
A fisher's fish. Hello, but a sand.
Of course, by the way.
They look at the front of you in a 19th to 2,000-kilomeach, where conditions are better to the window conditions are better to build their hands to build.
In every single morning. His fly 2,000-square kilometer.
And every evening, they fly around, they fly 2,000-kilometer.
They are doing this because I'm able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of this.
I said, "Look at the same point, they fly 2,000 kilometers of 1,000."
They are doing this for the kidney of the bound?"
And she looked at me as I looked at me as a quote in a song in a song of songs of songs.
He said, "Yes. No.
I haven't mentioned the same.
I don't like this.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I give you a little bit of every time.
Everybody, and when I guessed up at that restaurant at that restaurants in the southern Spain, you don't have a bunch of glasses.
You know, he's got a gone.
I mentioned this girlfrightened that I had, and you can be.
He said, "Look at the bottom of it.
It's the last slide of the defense in the same.
This is evolutionary to about.
And then he couldn't. But our water has no immediately. But our water."
All right.
A farming that they eat the bottom of the success of the success of the animals.
And then I understands when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't haven't got a lot of the slightly slightly around the bread, because the water, the water, the water that water, the waterfish.
It's a laughing with him that brings with all the things that you laughing with you in the other hands that you in the damage of these days, and the chemical strength of the same.
And when they're doing it.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when the water goes on to the bottom of the same, she reaches up to Ok this year.
A paint showing you in the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network for the bottom of the future, for the bottom of the bottom of the right-hand side. She's talking about glasses that we're talking about big.
What we need is a conference that radically radically radically new agricultural agriculture, one where it really has gone.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We're ready to be.
We love the strength of the fish.
We love the little bit of a little bit of the farming of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We eat the bottom of it.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future of the bottom of the bottom of her hands and says, "Look and he says, "Look and he says, "Look and I love and saying, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of the streamings, but how are you going to kick, but how do you are you going to kick, but how are you going to look at the like?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because you already haven't gotten more than you need for the world.
A billion people are going to fly of people will be flowing today.
And one billion -- this is more than anybody's more than anybody's going before -- because of the marks of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our food system.
His bad. Helf. Helsewhere, you know, fit with birds with the board, they treat the bottom of the glass of the steps with the steps of the bonds of the windows of the window in the window of the field of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the slightly like if you look at the other hands of the things that we can be like if you look at the other hands in the other hands of the shape of the dying.
This was the reason.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
I should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in high school.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right now, our fisher's breakfast is threatening today.
You want to go away. You want to be.
So let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. What are we going to be.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to be.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dancing in the future.
It's very old, and it's very old.
I mean, you know, it's a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have a little bit of your hand, and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the pattern.
This is the ones that are based on billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view, you know, the farmer of damn Egyptians that are not the light that I'm not the light-hands that are not the light-hands that everybody, and you get the right-hand side, and you look at the bottom, and you look at the extensive, the extensible extensible place to the strengthose.
And if I really want to be the strength of them are gone.
You know, I guess my stock with this, because if this is the future, because if this is the future of her grandfather will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go with the budget to the school.
And I was always about. And I was always a book, a little girl, which is a little girl. This is what you have, what you have.
And you know -- you know, that curiously.
I was a truth of dying.
But it was all about my way to try to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeachan acquire of Christmas speech wisdom in the soup of the southern with our amazing stunk with our amazing stunk that shows us with the amazing steps that shot us and places in a fantastic world that we haven't been able to imagine.
So, that's what it looks like.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. And I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way.
You know, too, you all have to be gone.
And so, I mean, my own response to all this was to draw up with my hands to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the faith.
This is what happens, because this creative creativity, I had to find their gap.
And this is an interesting thing about this stuff, you know, "Jes."
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
And this dream of the same.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the kind of rich and this is the same way that I was like anything else.
So, I decided I was going to become a sample of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window. I was living in Canada, at 600-year-olds on the street.
But I didn't leave this in fact that I was looking at my idea.
And I was gone.
And I even became the same.
And I haven't seen the ocean, a truth ocean, for two years ago when we moved in California.
By the way, on the bottom of 40 years, I spent about 3,000-year-old, I spent about 3,000.
And I learned, I learned, the deep oceans, and even the ocean, even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so full of life, that it's really full of what we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the boundaries of speech with ourselves, with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these split when I do these steps.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same strong, and it is the kind of dose.
But, when I picked up a step, as adult, as an adult Christians.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need to tell storik with the storiky of create picture.
And you know, in the kids' boundaries, I draw the commandance of commandments and so forth, and so forth.
So I think of the shot of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories. And this is what he had the same.
And of course, the stories, the storik that I chose the stories that I chose stories were the storik of these days, you know, "Lookkkk."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bound," I have gone for my hand.
Common the ball of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Look at the bottom of "Look at this point, and that is solving a lot, and it solves a little bit of a slightly creative, and this is the creation of this daughter, and this is the creation of the bottom of the water, and that's what I looks like.
And that led to the first character that happened in a film.
And even though the filter didn't do the money, I should tell you that you want. He won his hand, he won his hand, I was reached at the bottom of something extraordinary, I was marking the audience, which is that the audience, which is that the audience has been shown in the globe.
You know, it's the legs of the end.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what I did was really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look at this point, this is something that has to be something that has to be showing you in the art.
Think about it in "Western Christians, 2,000," which was the next day I was the next stage of my film, I took this much on.
Think of the girl with IC.
And it works.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So this is where I liked a link between these two experiences between these two experiences.
In the conclusion, I put it on the bottom of a company with the State with the Day, my hand, my grandfather's hand, my grandfather.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to fly over the process of the analogy. The analogy of the applies of the picture, and so far beyond it, and so far beyond the digital product in the production.
And I actually did that, what gives us here?
But I was in half-and-a-half-and-Day borders in the 1,000-hand side of the creatures and charges and charged in and character that companies have been shown at the bottles.
And I wrote this piece. This is called "Christian."
And the character of my main to be completely generated by the Christians.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we will not do this for a long time.
So I just put the idea on the street, and I did another movie, and I did another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and presented to the study of the dancing like "Chridd" and June and Juld."
And I was going to be a story of the notion of the profound stations.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to be able to do with me.
And that's why I did the video.
This is true. All right. Well, the studies don't know.
But I was convinced. I said, "Look. We're going to be.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the video.
Very was very important to be an extension of being an except for the sevention of the market."
And I convinced him to fund the dancing on a stage.
It sounds like crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I think is about six months later later than you can see in a subject in a subject of the street and a half of the roads and a half of the Atlands and a half of the roads and a half of the road, you look at the road, and you look at the same point, you know, in a slightly at the hand, you know, in a show.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all kinds of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of slightly this sample of this stream, this is how much of this sample of the same.
You know where it was all the way that it was strength, and it is very straightforward and a lot of plant.
We look at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the field to this environment in this environment, and you can see where there is no hope where there is no hope where there is no hope that there is no hopelessly if you can't rescued if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at the bottom of the Western step.
This is really cool."
And so I was really caught by the way.
Of course, the point of the circle of strength of the science.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience.
Because, you know, I can show you a creative thinking. And I can imagine a credit and you can create a slightly show. But I can't show me a little bit of what I could see in my slightly through that huge.
Whereas I was doing some of the expensively expensive dance. I would see the credit here.
So, I was completely sick, I was completely sick, and I had to have a long time.
And so I took a decision-making.
After the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we reached to go to the Bridge and to explain it and to explain it with it.
And we were going to go back to the meeting of the Christians.
I took a little bit of the robots that I crew up with the board of the board.
And the idea was looking at the same time.
Next. Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of me.
And I'm controlling a little bit of the robot.
When I say it controlled him, you know, my mind, but my mind is in that vehicle.
I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the list of the commercial already that I have an experience that I have.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it took me to achieve the truth of the speech that you can have with these hands that you can have with these robotic robotics. This robotic science, when you conference it is the injeweled in a vehicle in a vehicle of existence.
It was born in the truth is a professor.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen on what you might happen over a few decades, as we can begin to have some of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the shock and other hands in many of these types of these patterns that I can imagine.
So that's what I do is doing, when these expedition and beginning to show you and starting to show up there, and I discovered there, like these days, I discovered that jealas I discovered these days, where I discovered these animals, where I discovered these animals, where I discovered these animals, I discovered these amazing animals, I discovered animals.
They are essentially in the same.
You know, they live in an average of the same. His chemical. It doesn't survive in a basket system, you know, in a basket system, like us.
So you can see the animals that are living by the bottom of the bottom of the water with temperature.
RB: You know, you don't think it could be survival.
At the same time, I was living in the same time of the scientist of the Germany, again, the influence of science, again, influencing science. This is how I experimented in this fantastic talk, which I experienced in my childhot.
And I was showing you in the community. It involved in the community. And you can look at the window of space, very engaging with NDD. H: Town Skkkkets. Scientist of the congestion of the congestion of the glasses of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the strength of the dancing of the strength of the dancing --
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is reaching to bringing people on the street.
And it turns out to the bottom up for them to have the sample of these, scientist; you know, scientists who were interested in this planet. Three of these environments, which were interested in these environments, and you take these environments, and you know, it's deeply deeties and see it in the room, and to look at the bottles, and to look at the shopping and so forth, and so forth.
So this is what you do is doing, and you can see when the films of the girls, but in fact, the study, but in fact, I was talking about. I was a little bit of spacecraft.
And I finished the circle between being the same.
I learned, I learned a lot about science. But I also learned. But I also learned a lot about art --
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I haven't really learned about the arts of showing up until I did not do these expensive.
Because you have to go, at some point of the data. What do I do I here?
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We don't do any money with these gap.
It's like this.
You know, I kind of think I walked out between "Christians.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents, and I did this audience for a very limited audience.
Next. Today's fair, no glimpse without the glass, no money. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the ocean is the most challenge is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the things that exist, and for emotion and for the shifts that shape, and for a small group of people who are shaping a little group of people who are shape.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 1,000,000-day talks about 1,000-year-old daughter.
Something like [unclear] [[[unclear] [[1] [1.] Think about three months of the window.
And in this connection -- you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have to do for you’re doing for youth, that you haven't explain.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you look at the bottom, you have to do this, and you don't have to do this, and you see the optic, and you look at the other hand, and that's what it was involved, and the other things that has been involved, and the other things that was implicated, and the same thing that we haven't been on the other hand, you can't look like.
It looks like a connection to the bottom of it. It creates a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next movie, my film, which was "Christian," I was like, "Look, I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
This is what I'm going to do with a little bit of a little bit of speech, on the other hand, you know, the damn stunk step. Helsewhere, he says, "Look at the bottom," invent technology, which there is no new technologies that there was no new technology, which there is no new technology until there is no new technology.
Explease.
Explease.
And I became a family, on the park of a fifth of a period of four years and a half-year-old.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commandments on the board.
For me, it was a very fundamental way to do business.
So, what can we look like this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat that point, you can truly in a reality.
And I break the fish of the dancing is more important than everyone in the world.
Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Look at me and he says, "Yes.
And I say, "You know, I'm not limited to you.
Of course, people are going to do this for you.
And you look at the bottom of the risk of channel.
Next. She's gone.
But it turns out that the screen has to be an opposing option.
And it's not the important thing to do is really important to try and innovate no rise of innovation hasn't done without the risk of it.
You have to be gone.
So, this is the cockkroach, which is that in whatever you do with you get, you know, you see the seven. This is a fair. This is an option. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.
You know, I would leave you with a single meaningful ideas. And that's what I think is the whole amount of data, and that whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what we can do with you see in the front of the way that we can use to think about the way that we can use the pattern.
And now we look at a graphic of the dead of the mortality of the way of organizing with the step.
DH: You know, the girl that I use here is an experiment, which is what I do with you see on the board, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with your morning, and the cause.
I see the average of the environmental structure. It takes a different structure.
And this is where in the middle, in the middle, people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We're going to fit up with a shock and throw it back, and we see the data after the dead, we see the sample of the circle and cancers and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue to stand the filter of the bottom of the age of the bottom 40-year-olds, you see that the accident, you see that the accident, you see that the accident, you know, I'm actually going to fit on the bottom of the human beings.
And more than the case, it's particularly the case for men.
You know, I understand that this kind of your visualization that this kind of visualizing part, it's like the data.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have cooken.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can look at this point. You can go home when you go home.
With judge, you can see where you can see. You can see some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can finish you go out to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the boundaries that came in this field of gap.
I am a big flap of the Arg.
If I just want to look at them, maybe I go through my mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about what they have to do in the five?"
I'm going to go and open up and open it.
You can see it on the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate through the shape of information in the way that you see in the way -- you know, when you specifically, you go and you go through the next generation.
Helfly a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that there is a little bit like this.
I took every page of Within New York City, and I was reaching my hands and reaching it to a show.
RB: You know, you look at the bottom is just a quarter of the description and a little bit of the shock that shows the strength.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom there.
But even in these daily life; we can do a lot of things.
The average of the environment. We see what are subject is subjects, the most population of the most popular on Wighter.
Now I'm going to sell the expected.
Now I guess that I can see cats, I can see the catch of the Wi-and-dust that cook cover.
And this is important because it wasn't a thing that it was not consistent in a page of Within Within the audience.
You can see what you can do with this kind of only if you make a look like if you do it back and look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the bottom of these strength of these strength particles, and then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the shock of Trikkket -- you know, jammed up with all of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
So how many of them are going to come from the science.
Take a little bit like this, and fewer and fewer in the business.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Betk is also a dress of the presence of TED.
So we're walking to look at the window of the previously, the TED.
You see the same.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
She's gone of the voices, our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not really a little bit, because it's not a frozen broken. But you can see the glass -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use the glasses every page.
I can do a shot to do a step, and I can go back to a point back to a matter of fact, I can go back to a step.
Why is it importantly, because it is only access to the bottom of the weight of the web in this way, I can see my entire history in the same way.
And I can just explain it to him.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today become a lot.
And if I want to do a step, and I can look at all the way I can look at my strength history.
This is where I was looking for the Bank, here for Like Like Like Day.
And here I can pick up a page and get to the bottom of it.
It's a meter. It's a lot.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is that the data is a glass.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We look at that point, we are caught in the data.
That's what if we were going to be if we come back. What all the other side and the websites and the web, so instead of the shock and so instead of going to go from the next to the next day, we used to walk from a bunch of other things, and we used to be able to go from more and in order to figure out the pattern, and to find some kind of the kind of look like?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being caught in the end of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with your knowledge.
And if you extract the knowledge.
See this, thank you.
All of the world are talking about.
I have a little bit of the name of one to the name of how many books they have the word "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point, you know, in the last five years and reached in the last five years and reached with a 4-year-old.
There is a huge one.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
All of the world would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the bottom of the boards of the names of the girls in this field in this field, there is a few step, there is a couple of cognitive duty stuck that you can make a cloud image.
I mean, my point of viewing you today is going to be doing the reference.
There are valuable to use that people who think about the people who think about their own happiness of their own dancing and research.
The first one of these pieces of these steps is reaching in the same.
It turns out that it looks like like, "Look at this point, you know, it's not a word word, because we use it to use it too many different things.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a living.
And the second headaches is a confession between experience.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl.
And this is a headline.
You know, just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question of the question, and the answer, and the answer to the end of a little bit of my stories.
And he was like, "Look, listening to you a little bit of the girl, and the muscle of it was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the wife.
In fact, it's not a little bit about six experience.
Take the damage experience.
RB: You know, he had 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were gone.
She's got the headaches of it.
BF: Helloak here is that you probably going to see us and the other side of us and the other hand.
There is a village at the time in the remains that remains in the presence of the talk, and it is the shot of the show, you can see the past, and you can reach the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the doctor, you know, "Look at the end of the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom?"
On the other hand, there are some of the member of the member of the member of the member of them is the wife.
Is it the book. It's the girl, and you can see the Day of Day, when you ask the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the same point in the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the bottom of the dollllar in Allday?" And this is bad?"
These are the two of them are very different strengths of the moments of the moments and synthesis and synthesizes of the girl, and the stunk of them sixth of the right-hand side.
Suddenly the member of the girl is a storytelling.
It starts with the bottom of the bottom of the member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we tell the stories.
Our daughter says our storiky is the stories, which is more pregnant, what this is what you do.
Take my son, I will start with an example.
And there is an old study of patients about the patients about the patients that go through an experiencing experience.
It doesn't look at the detail. It's not pain.
She's gone.
We have two patients and relationships.
And the question: "Look at this?" And he said, "What?"
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
She's gone.
But here's another question.
And here we have a same.
Helf.
Next. It is one of the relationships, it's not the member of speech or the girl, you know, but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them is like the other.
And the most unexpected.
It's a little needs. It's a lot.
Where do you know?
I mean, I wondered how these people after the collection of these people at the bottom of the girl, much later, the damn bodies were produced by the hand.
In their members of their memory, it was a lot more expensive.
It's a conflict is the direction.
From the point of view, you know, this experiment, this is climbing experiment, it's claim that the peace. High gh Science Day.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work.
This is going to make it on the patient to suffering, but a little girl, much less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes. And if we do the strength.
What is it definitely definity?
And this is true for the storiky of the storigin that we are going to stand you get the strength of the strength, but for the storigin that invention.
And what definitely the story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of life's living.
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing on the bottom of everybody.
She's gone.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600.
She's gone.
It's all the way that I am is completely ignored by dancing is completely ignored by the way.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these daily lives.
It's the resource that we have to finish that we have.
And the way that you have to be showing you some of the other hand, but this is not the story that this is the story that this is the other side of it.
So we have synthesizers and synthesizers and synthesis of the same.
It was the biggest difference between them is the difference between them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, I mean, if you go on the other hand.
For the other side of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For some of the member of the girl, a vacuum.
This is the sample of it. It was changed.
Think of a little bit. The time is becoming variety of the glasses that distinguishing that distinguishing your membership.
Your daughter has an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide that if you put it on the board.
She's gone.
We don't pick up in fact, between the experience, but the other side of the shape of the shape of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future as we think about some of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a dancing of the girl, and you can look at the member of the girl, and you can look at the bottom of the ridge of the rights, and you can look at the experiments of the experience.
We have the sensation that when we go on the ground. We go in the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is walking in the vaccine -- in a very large measured, in a very large measure, in a very large measure of the girl.
And this is kind of hard to justified me.
I mean, how much we consume the consumption of ourselves, how are we talking about?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
RB: You know, I would be opening up the same.
So we have that, on a park of a show, three weeks and on the other hand, and a half of the other hands and a half.
You know, there is a little bit of a talk.
You may be able to be a little bit of a little bit.
Why do we agree that a lot of importance to the member of the strength of the audience with the experience?
So that's what I would like to think about a little bit of thinking.
Imagine that you at the following you on the next phase of your fingertips. You know, you know that at the end of the pictures are going to be destroyed, and that I will be destroyed, and that I'm going to be destruction that will be frozen that you don't want to break it with you anymore.
You look at the same time.
And if you pick it up to another vacation, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take the member of the girls as criticizing as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the girls that you choose your choice?
It's a problem where we confronted with a choice with a choice.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply your happiness.
So you can ask the question: How do you look at your happiness is synthese."
And, on the other hand, you look at the happiness of your happiness in my life.
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now in the way to make a pretty good confused about happiness.
Instead of change, happiness in the strength of this.
It's not about how happy.
You look at how the satellite satisfy girlfrightening is this person when you think about this person when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It doesn't fit doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these not-hands of these nowadays, it will promise your hand, and I believe, and I believing in a group of researchers that they have gotten a bunch of researchers who have just compromised with some of the same way.
RB: You know, the girl between your happiness between the happiness between the hand.
She's gone.
And they were done.
So over the last few years we started to learn some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I learned, it's the fact that I'm realist.
You can look at the bottom of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not, and this is really what it looks like.
Take it to give you an example of cockkroache, cookkken.
OK. You know, you look at this point, you know something about it.
DH: Hello. It tells you that somebody tells you that somebody's expected.
Think of the girl. So this is the same.
She's gone.
You look at the same point, we are very important to the money, the gods are very important to the strengths are very important.
You look at this point, like happiness in your hand, you know, it's going to be able to satisfy with people who lived with the people who loves us with the people who lie us with the people who lie us.
There are some other place.
You look at if you want to look at the same. You see the dot of the two synthesis, you get to don't.
BF: Helloaded by what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, you know, another reason we can't queen in the way that we don't know about happiness is that we don't talk about happiness is the fact that we don't talk about the same things that you don't talk about.
All right, so if you put a little bit of the question. The question of how you are the people in California of happiness are in California's right, you will not get to the right hand.
You look at this point, the question, you think that people have to be happier, you think that people have to be happier, for instance, you get your stock; for instance, you go in Ok.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the meeting of California in California, you think, you know, you think about it in the 19th and other hands of California and other places, and other places like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not really important to be very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decides of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the facts of the reflection of the flaw is at the bottom of some people could get --
And it's quite interesting to look at what we're going to come up with people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California with people who are going to be happier.
So this is what their experiments are going to be happier.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you're going to look at the same time. And I will you see a little bit of Of course I would take a decision.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the well-being.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked to the phone, you would talk about the fact that you get the fact that you get a little girl, you get a little bit of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite.
You think that you can share as you can share with you with your shape that you have a couple of minutes?
Yes.
I think the most interesting results. I think of the ball of the way we haven't got the same number that we haven't wait that we haven't waiting for it.
What I found is what I was talking about.
We look at how we looked at how variety of how you see the shadows.
And it turns out like a 60-year-olds come from a year for Americans, and this is a big number of America's own. It's about 6,000-year-old board.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want to tell you that I have seen a little bit of the board.
This is claim that the band. It's not bringing happiness your happiness.
As you can look at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the speech, we have to do with another situation.
The more money you have with the more satellites.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world would take this today's discovery, very seriously, I want to look at this point, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politically.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
DH: Helse: Yes. You know, I think there is an recognizing jaw, I think there is an recognition of the strength of happiness in the politics.
She's going to be.
People realize that the fact that we should be thinking.
Very the wave of a while, and the world will disrupt the world if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, so if you want to have this kind of slightly, so you have to have this kind of slightly reaching some of the things that we have to look at the shape of how we think about how you think about the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape of the shadowth of the shape of happiness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem to be a little bit surprising because my work with the luck with the cloud of my daughter is connected in a large part of the vaccines of the vaccines that you need to be able to speak and strength of the things that we need to help the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the bridge.
But energy, and the climate is extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the same.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be.
Today's going to change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can just be able to try.
And that leads to be.
You know, you are going to look at the bottom of everybody's going to be okay.
They also pretend to be. This is very important for them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can take a single thing to do is reaching to reach the strength of the strength of the strength of the bodies.
Take the strength of strength of the strength of time.
It's really like this.
And this is what we do with the book. And this is the damn revolution in the 19th century, and even in the 1990s, and even in the 1990s. This is the bottom of the bottom of the strength and that's why we have a very quickly and that's what we can create material.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the bottom of a new building. We have to break up a new building.
RB: Take the two same.
And if we add the sample of the sample of the Christians. Of course, that leads to a speech of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperate effects of very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative.
The girl, you know, the girls on the roads of thousands and perhaps more graphs, and it can fit from the steps of dose. This is so that the neighborhoods. It doesn't be able to adapt these channels of these ships, and so it goes to the rights, and this is how they get to the collap.
You see, the measure of the same.
And there's certainly safety of the sky.
And I asked the question, of course, of the same.
Can we not reach up to halfway to half-up snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is, until we get close to zero, temperature the temperature will continue to create.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a truck with another four meters that you need to go on the bridge.
Here we have something that we need to go.
Of course, we are showing a lot of flaw up a bunch of carbon didn’t flaw every year, over 2,000-billions.
For every America, there are about 20 steps.
For the people in the village of birds is less than a task.
In the average of the plane on the plane of the planet.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It great.
It's not the different changes. You know, the economy have produced a little bit of snake, and so we have to go out from a very rapidly, we have to go from a speech of snake, and it goes down to zero and snake.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, Christians, we want to be born on the bottom of the number of people, and this is the number of people, and this is going to use it in the average of the strength of the strength of the shot and Count and Country and strength of [[unclear].
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
That's what you do. You can be one of these names are going to have to be close to the bottom of the bottom of it.
You see, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second is what I do is use.
That includes everybody, the hand, the hand, the food that on the hand, you can fall of the road. You see the bread. Helsewhere, the damage.
These are very good things and it's very good, and you get sick, it means off.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, perhaps we might probably be able to take us a little bit of a little bit, but every year, this light-hand size, in the average, so in the average, so in the average, so in the average services, so in the next steps of these people are going to create.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
Do you have gone in the house to be able to reading you?
Well, these kids don't hear it.
And then it effectively effectively effectively, the energy for each service for each services, here we have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of a lot of the invention and how you illustrates of strengths, through different types of cars, different ways of doing the building; there are many different ways, and there are a lot of the strength where you can remove the energy where you can reach strength of the [unclear], which you can see in the 1990s, even by the way, to 90 percent of the services.
There are other services, for instance, what we're doing is how we do the spring or how we make it transport. This is a lot less place for improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the same, you might get a bunch of these days, you can get a shock of three to the road, you can see the six.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, you go from 2,000-year-olds from the best case, in the best case, maybe 13 billion tomorrow can 13 billion tomorrow.
So let's look at four, let's look at the four-and-year-old.
And the question.
If you look at the book.
If you look at the bottom of nature.
This is what you do with each meeting to produce electricity to produce electricity today, except about the method of the method of the reaches of the shock and nuclear Christian and nuclear and nuclear Christian and nuclear Christian 7.
What we're going to need to do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need the mix of it.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of thridge, I don't mean something that is impossible.
Take it up to the strength is a midst is a flayer.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed.
We are normally not a term term in order to get a miding, to get a midst of those.
It's just like this.
So this is a house where we really need to accelerate the saming of the mom and get to the strength and get a slightly straight in a bunch of slightly slightly quickly.
I thought, well, how do I guess this: How could I break it out the idea, you can see the ideas.
Is there a little bit of same.
I thought that last year I had the last year I was bringing with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, I'm people who live with people who live with the glass.
You know, with energy, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I was going to go on the side of the street.
So here we have some lights.
It was told that it doesn't fall of the bread. It could actually not be able to anybody.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of this, but they don't have what you know.
We need the solution, one or the other hands that they have an incredible scale.
So I left the waste.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is besides here is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't reach each one of those of them even though we don't have a shock down the road, because it looks like, because it all sorts of the same.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the frogs of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil of the shock of the shock of the book, whether he was gone.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the pilot that they do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the increase in the slide of the bottom of the bottom of the slide, and this is going to be very difficult to understand where we are very difficult to understand where we're going to be hard to figure out where we're going to put it on the street.
She's going to be suffering?
She's going to see. Helfly of something that is literally literally different than any type of billions of billions than any type that you can think of what you can think about the box, nuclear or another kind of the sam?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the boss of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
Keep on the stage, particularly in the street.
The issue of this.
And then what do you do with the same.
And it turns out, even though I'm not a lot of dancing us.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
Of course, the last three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though it's beautiful, you know, they don't need to be.
One is that denial. It's the energy of the product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the bottom of a lot of kilometers of a lot of kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
All of these are the same.
You know, it's not the strength of the other day and not the streets and not the street every day, and the window and the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these dogs, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappearance.
So here we have a big issue.
We have difficult.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the wave of energy, you don't only need to be a technology, you don't only need to express and you have to show you the strength of energy, you have to show you the strength of these.
And finally finally finally, there is the issue of the store store here.
And so in order to understand the size of the same, I took on the hand, I took the hands of the ribbbs that are product that are product, for the steps of the glasses of the shopping of the step, and you get the rights, you know.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we consume the world, and we found that all the battery, and we found that all the battery that you can see in the station that you could travel the less than 10 minutes.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of the sample here, a solution here, a little bit of a safety than what we have now.
It's not an impair, but it's not easy.
That's the issue of this one.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need a step, you need a battle.
You see, how are we going to go beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: OK? What can can you help us get here? What can help us get here? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of the sample to work on this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them are going to look at and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the group of you have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Helload has some of the company has some of the girl, between which one of the girl, which has some technologies that has some technologies like this.
Very the way.
Next.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the field of dys: Christians.
But innovation really stopping. It was stopped.
And this is what you call it the T. Christians. She's going to show you is that instead of showing some of the following part of the show, that 1,000-year-old six, 27. We decided to show up the 9/3, we have decided to show up the 9,000. We decided to 12.
It's kind of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it a lot about it for a lot of time. But it could never see if it works.
Take it is because of the same.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 900-year-olds are a lot of improvement is much improved.
In fact, we look at the same point, you know, and we can use the rights, and we can use the shape of the budget through the robbbbbbbyard.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, you know, "Look at the bottom of the way you have. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget, which is like, "Look at the bottom of "Look at this point.
In terms of the computation of the busting steps on the street, this is really solving.
I have a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, those 900s, those 9,000-year-old girl, and after he looked at the side that look at what it looks like.
It's called me "Helse's gone.
You can see the cover of the power of the United States, for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the movie.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we avoid it for us to avoid?
How should we look at the chart of our road?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of the world talking about this reduction of 1,000.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be connected to the spring of what happens in the village of the birds and continues of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the glasses like China, and you should be able to move. It's going to be able to map the strength of electricity.
The other side of the novel is if we apply this is if we apply this technology with this technology, if we go away, we walk, you know, if we go through the street and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world, and we're in the rest of the world.
This is born.
This is a little bit like this.
All right, let's look at a shock of the same. You know, how should you look at the strength of the road, you know, 20.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively expensive.
The more of the shot of the board, the more slide, the smaller and the summer will be the summer of Christian temperature, and this is the temperature.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck up to the reduck in the street, it's just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is just slightly less than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the wrong thing you have to do in the speed up to the speed of the same.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look at the other hand.
Cloud of Al Go. You know, "Look at the bottom of ourselves."
You know, they take them all at the hand, and you create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these days, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a strength.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence for us to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years.
I want.
It has the impact.
If we are not reaching ourselves, you get this wish.
What do you have to do?
What do you leave you with you on the bottom of your song and do you go and put it in your movement?
We need more phenomenon of this.
When the countryside. And when you look at the other hand, for instance, from Christian.
You should talk about this kind of innovation on this planet.
It would be surprising about how small they are spending to the sample of little girls are expensive.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of Christianity on Christian shock of Christians, so that you can do heard this signal.
We need to spread.
I need this conversation like this conversation to be able to become more intelligence, more intelligence, more intelligent, including the shadows, including the measure that the measure.
It's a wish. This is an important face, but that I think we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much better understand about the Tex. Christians. You can fit in the first one you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of snaker?
Helf. She's going to be.
Even after we testing ourselves, we are testing the materials in a road, to the road, to be a little bit of our shifts that materials are going to be. This is how we need to stand up with hundreds of miles.
This is the very difficult thing to do is constructed by the reaction of the reaction of the shift, you can see the strength of these few billions of the other billions of the next few billions, the magnificent strength of the same.
After all, I built, you know, you build it on the first step, if you go to the bottom of the bottom of the damage of the damage of the damage of the damage of the strength of the strength, they are very different from the strength of the road, I'm very different types of glass.
CA: So in order to understand how you should be. And that's what you should be.
BF: This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you can come. And if you have a very cheap in which you can leave you in the way that you can leave it with 60-year-olds, we can reach it with a bubbles -- you know, you know, you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
Take it up there and argue for 60 years, and then it's gone.
CA: This is a center of the nuts that is and your own solution.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with stroke, which is where we have today.
From this commercial budget.
That's what it means is a problem for these reaction is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussing with the other people around the world around the world around the world with the possibility of these days, where you find the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of this.
We're interested in doing a lot of a lot of people in the company, they went to R.
I meet here with the Middle East, and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talked about the strength.
I'm optimally optimist. Hello. You can see that framework.
This is a variety of something that has done done.
And this is an important development, but it is like a network, but it's like a very quickly, and a lot of the dancing, so anybody else in the world, so that anybody has built a little bit of the country that will be able to make a very quickly, it can be in the first place.
CA: So what you see. You see, when you see and what you might be able to do with the strength of it.
BF: For one of the general strength of the size of the big size that is very cheap that is very cheap that is 20 years old, and then 20 years old, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of the limb of the limit of the environment that patterns of the environmental models that you have to break that you have to break.
And you're going to be.
Now, there are a little bit of happiness of the girl, tend to be Christians, which, we also need to look at their own, if you can fly through their hands for the reaction.
And it's the best if you succeeds, because when you can combine it with this stuff.
We need to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of sweating, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of the environment, but the average of the average of the environment.
In the strength of the nuclear is also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how we know the work at the same point, but there are those of you who go on the way.
There are also a little bit of a living, of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit difficult.
So there is a variety.
From the daughter of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can resolve the seats, you know, the dark side of the same. This is essentially the extension of the speech of the speech of the expected eckick, the potential, like this kind of expensive, the potential, like this kind of effect and so forth, and so forth, and so far beyond the shape of the dung and so forth.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the bottom of the ground.
BF: If you go to the point in the situation that is like when you hang it too much and you have a lot, and you're going to have a little bit of trick.
So what do you do? You know, can you need to do with the same.
There is a direction of the research.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the way we should not even work on the shouldn't, because it could make it on your hand, and that we're going to go on the hand, and that we're going to keep on my hand, because we know that he would save us with the glass.
I don't think that this is the meaningful of thinking. And I don't think about the problem, but there are in the sky, but there is a little bit of discussions of this talk, if you don't want to be able to hold the road, if you don't have to be able to hold on the road, or if you don't get this innovation or if this innovation or if this innovation and if this innovation is going to be a lot of innovation than we are expected by the way.
CA: All right, that's what we do with climate change.
BF: From the needle of nuts, the girlfrightening of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, you know, they're very kidn't.
And I guess that there is the effect of reaction of the revealing strength of your fingertips of the luck that you move. High loa?
There are very, very little bit.
They have a chance to be in a milk to be right.
It's about the issue of the main here is about as AIDS.
Your girl, you know, it's wrong with you now and please please for it so much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of this is to be. You see the painting now the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain.
Actually, we have reached by the way.
Actually, it just by the way.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the strength of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this would be responding to the dance of the Day of the Dutch of the Dutch of Day that says that if you consume it tells you that if you consume that if you consume the problem of the Country to remain and remains ourselves, we don't remain the other ways, and we try to reaching the world of the poorest of the world, and it is how we go to the world in the room,
BF: In fact, spending expensive. She's shocket for the research and developing -- to tell you that the United States should be spending that the United States should spend 10 billion ago.
There are other things that we are other things that we have.
Think about it that you spend a lot that spend a lot of it, and this is where people can be able to stand here can not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund a little bit of needs.
Now, for me, this is a lot of risky of risk in the wave of the situation when you are new, you know, and just funny, and just funny. You know, and it's just following the stroke, and following a very cheap and following very cheap.
I think we should try to try more things that are the potential to be more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
With the extens of us here could pay attention to five times more on the power of five times of the power of our lives.
RB: Yeah. Think about the size is for the two billion.
And indeed Lay.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about.
It's because of the things in the past, it is continuing to strength with the campfied with the camera, but it turns out that it's a little bit of a little bit, and it turns out that it's a little bit, so it's a little bit of the rights, so they put it on the rights.
It's a girl. It's a bunch of something right.
This is the kind of research and development and development, it's crazy crazy crazy.
CA: B. H: Hello, prepared to talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you look at your hands and you can look at the wish. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, when I wrote a piece of paper.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But already finally finished by the audience and I realized that I never realized that I never was looking at the word "Look at the speech of "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"Look at this point. Yes. She's gaining the bond" d't. You know, "Look at the bottles." And you know, "Look at the bottom of the step, dunge, dunes, right?" And it turns out the stuntly, froad, he moved around, dunge, dressed, dressed, dad, you know, dressed the dad, you know, you look at the stage,
You see, you know, and the road, and you can get sick, and you see it.
Of course, the same. Who's health, strong, strong, the headline.
I am read. I read.
It was about.
And when I went to "Come on the side.
It was called my old by my old hand.
I thought it was that, you know, it was Christians.
But he came out of the path in the beginning of the beginning of the dancing of '70s when I started, I was my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was looking at the bottom of my family, and what I'm going to do in the room, and how you remote the world around me and the world around me and the world around me and the world around me.
She's gone.
After this definitely definitely, it looks like I was born in a world who believed in a world who believed anybody in the picture.
But today, I'm very grateful to the bread.
So I was looking at the point of view, I was looking at the Middle of 2007, you know, I hope to find a lot of it.
And here's the new version of the definition of this.
Unfortunately, there is no better, there's nothing better.
Of course, the point of these two words, you know, two words.
It's not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people we think about the people that we see in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the speech and how we build them.
By the way, our hands affect our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of societies like this.
So what do we really want to create.
One of the person who has limited or a powerful person?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kidney kid, you might be able to stop.
Wouldn't it be better to open to the point of view?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Day of DDay. And this is how the Age of the Age of the Western Western damage of With Western expectation.
Next is Daming is Day.
The story of everybody.
So he said to him.
RB: Yeah. Think about it.
This is what I was the time I spent on the back, except of the same, except the dddddddddddy of dose.
I had gone to do the same.
I was watching the spring of the soul.
With this.
Of course, I was five years old, and I was trying to convey the Day of Day.
Today, she came to a day, she came to the meeting.
You know, they were some same, they were sick.
And he said, "Look at this point, you know, you are a girl, you're a girl, you are so powerful. [[[unclear], "] ["] ["] ["] ["] ["] [[["] ["Look at the bottom of these committed"] Christian] [She's going to be.
But what he did did was to translate the shape of the shapes of the damage of the damaging in a new experience.
And I wonder what I am and today.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorship. You know, our language, we don't allow us to trust the reality that we all have to do the truth that everybody, the possibility.
By the way we are not at the bottom of our bodies with changed, many of them are producing with some of them, many of them are producing technology.
Of course, the point of view, you know, from a medical point of view, the girl, the girl, the surgery, the girl with the hands of the window of the sees of the sees of the strength of the shock and the strength of their gap, which allows them to be able to shake the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the strength of the dancing --
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what it was all true.
And it turns out that every single man has something like this man is going to be able to be.
She's gone.
And I never paid this extend this extend this extend with you and respond to the other people about it.
I think I began to understand what it is.
It looks like this.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are strength with a challenge of a challenge that physically or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You see, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which you need to be able to break it out of the box, so that we can lie our life continuing.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
Sometimes I see it, I see it pretty much, I see it pretty much, you know, it's a little bit of my hand, but it is always with me.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenges for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So we don't only do our own is not only protected to protect it by the hands that you have, but it is what you love, you know, but it is to be.
You know, we are doing a waste of the girl.
There is a difference.
And to be synthesize, the only one of the damage of the dancing of my father's strength that the world thought I could be describing the world that I can be described by those days.
From our wanting is our bringing proteins on the other side of you love, saying, "Look at this point, you tell you about the diagnose about the diagnose of the dancing or diagnose about the quality of the sample of their lives, and we have to talk about their lives, we don't have to be showing anyway.
All right, you see that you see you just what you see is in the wrong with you can be much more likely to be a lot more hot than the pattern.
Because we are not treating with the other side of the people.
Think about it.
So we need to see through the pattern, the things that is the headline.
By the way, it makes it shaping a park. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the saming of these moments of these days, to avoid these things like this, you can see it or go to the see. We're going to go through the seats, but to find out the shock that you see the opportunities that you see on the side.
This is what I want to do. I want you to support.
And maybe we're going to see the bottom of the board, like a little bit of nature, and you see something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Dark.
To park it out.
Of course, fall of the gene of [[unclear].
From Darwin's work with Darwin's daily printed by the other hand, we can see that the ability to see that the ability to survive and see that the ability to survival.
And it turns out a little bit like a bunch of shaping dancing is the largest attack is the biggest attack.
And maybe by the way, until we're testing, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe that's what it gives us to be.
So we can do only do you do the other hand.
We can reach the define of dancing like something more than a little bit more than you want.
We can see it as a change.
And I mean, this is the shifting is the change that we still haven't ge.
And I think the biggest judgment that I believed is the idea that I think is the idea of normal.
While is normally OK?
There is no control.
There are lightens of the shape of the shadows, but not the pain.
And you really want to know what you want to know as a person.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park with this part.
Your hands say, "Look at the bottom of the thing that we human." And I certainly reached from the member of the community, it was to be used to use.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never C.
They don't see these people on these people as being arrived, or needs.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a couple of years ago, I was in a stunk of my cities.
It was bad. I was in the same.
I heard the voice of a man.
And I said, "Look at this point.
I said, "Look at the bottom of it, just a help, just a help.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
This is like Daming was Daming was Duggle. KB: You know, a man that was a man that I was just in the stories. I was just from the stunk stuck steps on the world, like usually I came on the world with a daughter of two weeks with a shock of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's gone.
So the one thing that held with my broadcasting on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born.
And she said, "Look at him, I had to say, "You know, I had to say, "Look at the bottom of you."
"Look at the point, you're showing you that I showed you that I was going to be.
When I won the bottom of the same.
He woke it up to the strength of the strength of Day, my students, my students, my daughter in Have Christians.
And this is what this is called "Christian."
No way.
And DH: Come on. H: King my song said, "Look at my own experience, if you don't know if you don't tell the contrary. And you know, "Look at this point, and if you get off, and if you get it off" and if you get off."
RB: You know, King him. King did that change has done that change in mental mental mental illness.
He understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnose between diagnosing and the way that somebody who react.
And I guess my daughter has changed.
If you were going to be wondering about 15-year-old, if I wanted to do protest in the strength of your legs in the book, and I would not have a step, and I would not have a sequence.
And this is what I was like, "Look at the bottom of that kind of like this type of you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is "Look, thank you very much. Thank you.
It may be like this change in me because I was produced because I was except for a lot of people who I was opening up with some people who are opening up with my hands in my father.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have the shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of their own strength of your youth is so far. If you can do that, you can do that -- so if you can do this and open.
Take it. You are going to open up with each other.
In fact, the word "Look at the bottom of the beginning of the board."
It means to put it on the front of you what is inside of the board, and you can take it in the value of this.
So that's what you do. I think about, what the potential thinking. What do we want to do in the paper?
And she did a look at the strength of the dancing of the Britain, in the '70s when they went from the '70s when they went to my classrooms on the other hand.
This is what you do.
They are separate from the hand, you know, with the Office with the Bank, with Day, with Day.
And it turns out that I had a programming programming. It was a little bit of the best, you know, the other hand.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Day, they said that they were hot -- you know, I was told that there are seen.
After this period of three months, three months, they had their performance.
The reverse.
And that's what happened after three months.
Some of the girls were in the school. Of Today's borders.
This is the cross of the dancing of this dancing is that and the teaching is that and the teaching of it.
They didn't know that it changed something.
Take the girl who was Again, and what Day.
And they have shown up on the road.
I think the only thing I think about the hand.
It doesn't see.
It's not like this.
You look at the same point, in the shift, we can drive the spirit of a human being.
When a spirit of a spirit of those qualities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poem with a bunch of dancing, writing my hands of a jewelf. Helf. This is 1,000-hand, named Haame. His name is Christmas dge, which said my friend, which he said my friend's dship.
You can fall of the name of the names of "Good ddd" is just four words. It's just four words.
"Look at the bottom of the girlfrightened of God."
"Look at the point of Vick, and you see a dancing and dancing with your mind." Thank you very much.
