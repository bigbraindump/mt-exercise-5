Take a couple of years ago, here at TEDstage here at TEDstage of King Spain, you know, this man called the Human named in the bond.
And the idea is quite simple.
Take the shot of four has to build some of you have to build the road.
Helsewhere, you know, you have to stay at the top of it.
And it turns out, you know, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that this is really hard, because the shape, the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And at that point, I have almost 70 strength of the shaming of designing around the world with my students and designing and designing and design architecture, and designing architecture and architecture. And this is a 50-handed and something in this shock and something in this hand, and something in this slightly in the hands of the shot taught and something like you can look at the other hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: Yeah. She's shocket about it, he imagines how it will show you how it would look at the seem of the board, and then they spend a lot of the planet.
She's gone. It goes on and throw up and throw it up to the gap.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at this point.
And there's a number of people who are part of the people who have a lot more and more than "Christ."
They are mindfulfilled by the way.
You see, of course, there are some of the other side that they have a lot more structure of structure.
And it's pretty amazing.
As you tell us thus then. You know, not only the produced by the other struck structure, but also the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know?
And he would like to say, "You know, I love to say, "Look at some of the kids don't lose the time I don't lose the speech of the Duting Skkkkk."
And I don't lose the time of the fight of the time.
But there is another reason.
This is that the students are training that are training to find out how to find out the right thing to the right step, right?
And it turns out it out.
And what happens is that, when you put it on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fish, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they start with the stunk is that they start with the window, and you build the bonds of the prototypes of the slightly stuck steps on the bottom of the bottom of the glimpses of the shock and so they have more gone. And so they have more gone.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have a response to the meaning of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the average, the average is about 20 countries.
Is it the best good?
It looks like this.
And why is this? Because they understand them? Because they understand the triangle of the dung and the patterns and models and models of the geek step. This is the kind of construction of structure.
So, the direction of this.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add the teams of the teams of a man from the hands of the dancing is the result of the shape of the hand.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner. And why is it too. And why can you see?
Because they have the strength of this.
I go through the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Comming.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have this structure.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, okay, you know, let's go to Christians.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in design?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. It doesn't build something that was not built something that was going to stand in the leg.
If a bit of a team would be built, to say, you know, a structure structure of three Christian structure of three days, it would be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of the big impacts have a strong?
I reached the breakfast of it.
What does it happen?
You know, I mean, they have learned the value of the process.
And the same way. And the same team has gone from the worst of the same.
They have cooking the road, the other struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you might ask: Why could you lose anybody and you lose the problem of somebody writing this stuff?
And the reasoning is, I held creature. I mean, the digital hands and the digital processes and the process of using the speech and processes that are built by the shape of what you are building and games and games and games and shape of the visual effects and the kind of visual effects and the visual effects of the visual effects.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has their own, right?
This challenge.
And so, you know, this is the value of this experience.
And for the one of the things that you can get, you can extend of the wild of the wildlife expectance.
They are also the struck struck with the strength.
There are also some example.
You can look at the record and record.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that design is really a sport.
We're going to be able to break the strength of the strength of all the sense of what we have, and to apply what we have better thinkings, and the feeling for the challenges in front of us and truth in the front of us.
And it turns out, you know, a little bit like this.
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's look at the point of view we have a machine. We have a car, a machine car.
And everybody elsewhere in this room, you see in this room, you have to go through it.
You can go back or go back and forth, but you can't remain is where you are.
And I wonder what you're going to do with you choose, you know, I put my friendships, and all of this question, and all they wanted to be.
I don't know. She's going to go back to the invention that before the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other side of the Iranid.
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I do not part of this group.
I don't want you to go back in time and not because I haven't because I don't have a spirit of adventure, but because I don't think of the option of the option of the option.
So, I want you to look at this point in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this planet.
It doesn't exist.
Everybody's strength of my grandparents didnâ€™t gap.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
Helsewhere, my parents are close to the 1,000-bread.
So it would be good to be thrid with nuts at the beginning of the speech that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
Good dunes like this. This is an incredible phenomenon. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
Very the way.
And it turns out that the philosophical data.
No.
I travelf.
In the rich world of samples that threatens that threatening millions of people with just a generation.
DH: Helfly arounding. Helf. Helf.
You know what?
Very the way.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
Unfortunately, there is no longer and there are no more and more and more problems, because there are other people's issues of many times, one of them, one of them is that weird, a billions, a billionth of humans in our hands every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
Helsewhere, you know, you can be.
If we are not inventing a little bit of a way to come up with this one.
So this is the question: Can we do this: Can we do this? I think yet.
I think this is obviously, I think we can produce food that we can produce the sky that we can eat the bottom of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can run this world with this world with energy that will not destroy it.
I really think that and it's not just a lot.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wandering with the night -- one of the things that I don't leave me with it.
We never had a bigger progress that you need a lot of progress than now and we haven't been able to use it in the situation of the way to use it in the way that we can do today.
We are in the same.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should come back, for three hundred years ago, before the Icelcelcelebrate Imagine Christmas lights, to discover it in order to discover it in which we fight for these things that we fight on the streets, all of these things with more front.
People are gone.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
Everybody, the world has justice to the opposite of the 1,000."
You don't have speech at the bottom of your own step.
And it took me something like this.
A hundred years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines about the vaccines for "The New York" for "The New Yorker."
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did to do with him, so I did what I do is use.
Scidence after these days, I wrote a article about a piece of paper dose.
Think about it as well. And the same thing that is only more important.
People were going to be.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and this is what I could not be able to understand how humans believe.
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, I did what you do.
I mean, I'm a little bit of a dyname; you look at today; you look at the bottom of the girlfrighten, and all of the step.
But these articles. They were meeting and I can't get the dress, and you realize which, I realized why.
It was because the sample of her fingertips that I'm going to go out of my mind. You know, they weren't gone.
They were boring people with my granddaughter, you know, the girl,
They were just like the people in this room in this room.
And I guess my bread.
But then I thought, okay.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way that we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
Thank you.
Take the bonds of it.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We were gone.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall out of a few numbers, and people will understand how it and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. She's gone.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
RB: You know, you ask the question, "Look at the bottom of the girl, you know, you see it.
You don't. You don't have.
But here's what this idea.
And I can say that, because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
An about 12 years ago, he published an article in the room, one of the same, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines in the room, and vaccines against the bottom of the river and the right-handed articles.
Thank you.
And they don't. They don't.
I really needed to be able to do the sample of the dancing of the dancing ... it's an important issue of this.
They came up with it.
RB: You see, there are some of the United States in the United States of the United States of Britain, in South Britain, in South Cancer and all said to me the same paper and all of the same paper and all of the same thing: There is no climbing cool, there is no climbing the strength of glasses.
I don't think about it.
We don't think a whole bunch of documentary damn documents from a network from a functioning of a little bit of a little bit of data that off.
But you know?
RB: You know, the girl, the girls have been disappearing and here is what the United States and here's what the United States, the United States is one of the world in the world, which is one of the village in the world in which routine.
This is the same. Helf. Helsewhere, you would have to be raising ourselves.
It's great.
What did we come up with here?
You know, I mean, you know, you really understand.
Does anybody here on the bottom of the bottly?
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It doesn't really happen.
In this summer doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen, but it happened to 1,000,000,000.
A lot of a bunch of birds because of the bridge of the bridge, 20 cases, 20 cases on the order.
But, because here was not going to happen, we can't think about this and people like J.C. . jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet and ignore the strength and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance Listry and ignorance.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we have to teach that we have to learn how to be.
And this guy, Jewish. His [[unclear], it was a window.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Today, no framework, no aggressive, the policy of dying.
Think of it in the middle of the middle. It doesn't see.
You look at the name of the name of Ok.
Take a little bit of what we developed a vaccine with a cockroaches against a wheel.
She's gone.
All right, right?
This is the go, just that Paul talk's talks about the boundaries, and how they are the pregnant, and how people should slow and that people should just slow.
And this is the same.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. When you talk about it in a audience in the audience, you can't fall of the snake, it can't be protected by the way.
And this is the same, because people like people like to say that I know what my children are going to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the board.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse and more worse and in the same, the children are going to die again, because of this, you know, it's just a statistic.
And they're not going to die.
How do you stay with the poll. She's gone.
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fairly fairly facing my son, and he told me that I'm kind of crazy.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have a check and vaccinated with the baby against the pollen against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen.
But everyday I don't know. You know, a guy can go on the side of the morning in the morning in a planet.
Very the way.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend us by doing it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
Take the Chinese same, a little antique antify of oxygen to work.
You know, I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
There are these things and these things and it comes up to the medicine with the alternative.
It looks like all the same thing.
You know, I'm doing it.
It's okay, you know, you want to pay attention to 1,000-billions of dollars for it.
Next.
Look at the bottom of the shape of the ship. She's going to be.
Why do we do this?
I think that I understand -- you know, I guess the mark of the steps of the girls.
Look at the bottom of the start.
And I should not have to have it.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so flowing around. And so you can be.
RB: You see it in the arts of the same.
It's fantastic.
But, in fact, it's a very seriously, because these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all kinds of objects.
No one of them in one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you know? When you look at this, humans and you say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point, you know, you're going to be doing what I want to do with the other people to do the other hand, makes it feel good."
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't know how to stand if the secret of the state of the state of the Western Spanish. Helf. This is the one that says, "Look at the bottom of it says, "Look at this point, you know, she says, "Look showing it up in the rooms of the glass of the magness." And it's like to look at the shock and it's a little bit.
When you go on the road, you go on the road, and the saming and the mom and the strength and the strength of the strength and science. You know, you get out of a place where you want.
RB: You know, you see in South Africa in South Africa of Tex.
She's killing 1,000-and-a-thousand thousand-and-and-and-dung glass on the road, and you see the glass and bonds are much more effectively effectively more efficient than drug is more effectively effectively effectively effective than you know that we know that we know that we know know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
She's about thousands of decades of thousands of decades.
Please. You don't, you know, I don't tell you that there is no consequence.
There are here.
This is the lack of the same.
It's a controver.
It's a controver.
This is the idea, it's not a science.
I mean, I have the hands of my hand, every task.
In the garden. She's gone.
And no fish.
There are no hands of Christians.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Something was okay, everybody, otherwise.
I got down the road.
Now we can do it in a different way.
RB: Of course, there is the risk of this.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the waste, and that can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
Don't you want to do this?
I have to be married. I mean, I don't understand.
That's what we do. We are testing against the bottom of the modify of genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be.
We don't want to be.
You know what I do you know is the answer to all this?
Yes, you have here.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is nowhere there is nothing to do with the science.
It's the legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
It's a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work.
In the next 50-year-olds will be going to have to be able to stand 70 percent more food.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't know.
Why? Why? Wow, you know, it's very difficult to change.
We don't want them to be. We don't want to eat people to eat the bottom of the same.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a chart.
Take the same.
Next.
And then people will be able to eat him.
Will not suffering, you know, and you know?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go?
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it this: Why are we going to do this?
Because we don't want to change.
It's just about change.
It's not about our strength of our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know, you know?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We're not able to describe something like this.
It's all the way -- you know, this is shame, it is under our level and even we have to slowly slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, you know, incredibly destroyed, you can say, "Look, you can say, "Look at this point in this book, you want to go out in this book, you know, you see the stunk of the day?"
Helf. She's going to be here.
Now, this is what you do with the dung in the press, but we have an occasion, but we have an occasion.
And we can program.
We can move it to the strength of it.
We need to have. We need these discussions and we have to think about itself, but when we have to think about it in the car.
I know that we can also see that we can see in my hand, I just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You see, in one day of the damage of Steve.
And it was a man to be a human, an Africans.
And I tell you a whole story that many of you know, because Steve. And he wrote a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, with R&amp;amp;D. H: Helf like Steve [unclear], like Steve [unclear], and Jam] [unclear], and Jame], and Jamamames and Jamdd] [unclear]], and you know, "] [unclear] [unclear].
Next. Today's breakfast of dance.
Thank you very much like to look at the bottom of the dancing of Steve. His to see speech or see the film and you can see the stunk of these two people, but you know, the other two people, but how the muscles of these two people, but how he does it helps with these two people, and then it was an instrumental strength of these two people, and then it was on the other hand, and then it was the shape of the shape of the slightly as well.
I mean, I was meeting on the stage.
Take a little bit of listen.
Very whatsoek in a very game in a very playful way.
I was talking about music. I was talking about the muscle I got a few days later, I got a few days later I said, "No."
Now, I have to mention that Next.
But, as a result now, it's pregnant to these wise.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of them as he explaining it as he explained it as he explaining a lot of these days, and the right-hand side, and you look at the streets in the streets in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkkill you with the glass of the dung on the side of the slightly in the hand.
And Nesson.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the shock and girl, and if someone stopping him.
And I was frankly, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started singing.
And I played the first part of the concert of the concert of his life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech yet.
It was like how it was the influence.
And the same.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see his own step, and he stood up with his life.
And I started talking about the museum, from Bankddge at Being Christian.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You can see the bread.
And while I was on the bottom and I was talking about. I was talking about the human being. It turned out of a part. It turned out to a bunch of dindindinner, and you see what he just came out of the street on the street on the street on the street of the right-hands of glamorously, in this muscle of the shadow, in this muscle of the slightly in the hand,
It's like this.
And for Net.
Because the music allows it allows to take their own thinkings, and you know, and it turns out to the stroke, and make them through the images and the creation and the creation and the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. And this is an event from the strength of the suffering.
And I understand. And I understood that this is the same.
This is the reason why we do the music we do museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and with our brains, and our artifacts, with our artists, with our creativity, and the path of these emotions that are our emotion in reality.
And the reality of the bottom of the expression of the fact. It is all of us, and you get us here.
And for Net.
You can finish the release of the muscle of the muscle of him, and you go back in a family.
I will always be doing the music with Net.
Thank you.
Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the Game.
RB: You can see the same.
So, please.
I am Jessons of Yes. I'm going to be. I'm an end. I'm an designer. I'm an designer of the game.
I think about the game.
And my goal for the next decade for the next decade is to try to the point of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the shape of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for that, and it involves to build more world, including the world, including the present of the pressure of the present here to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
Over the point of view, we are three billion hours per week on the week of the shock of the show.
One of the things that you might be thinking. It's very much time of you can think about the game.
It can too much of the time, helping with the steps of the things that we need to be able to solve it in the real world.
Together, it consistent, confidence research.
Take billions of hours on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers too.
So, this is probably a little bit of contrary.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave him.
If we want to solve the problem, we want to be.
This is why. This picture of the same.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a photograph called the Play of Day.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot in front of you in front of the today's play.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you're not a game. You can lose to lose a part of not a part of this photograph of this picture.
And it turns out that nobody notice that you neither new, you know, "Look at the bottom of the girl, but focused on the hand, you know, your emotion is a strong, and you look at the bottom of a very difficult issue for a very difficult issue for a very difficult problems.
If you are a today's son, you will see some of the fingertips some of the dung of the glass of the glass of your eyes. You see the slightly around and around the street and around the hands are signal.
And the same.
This is a game.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A window. It's a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary of the picture, you don't believe that you haven't really believe that you cannot touch it.
It was almost beyond the bottom of the board.
And when you end up there you are so sick, you know, you are going to discover that you're really capable.
This is a too.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that resolve of people who solve the world as we try to remote around the world as we try to remove the next century.
BF: Hello. She's going to be which, with you why, it's on the way to get a window.
Now on the bottom of the same, this is a face that we see more often in our life, as far as we see in our lives.
This is what I call "Christian face, I'm not good at all.
And this is where I do this stuff, he was doing this today? Can you see? Yes. Can you see it here? Yeah.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at living. I'm not good at all.
Here is a piece of fish.
In Bero.
And this is a problem that many games you have.
All right, you know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't refer to my grandfather as "["] ["] [unclear], even though this is a component of a little bit more in the games than in the real life, but when they say good life's life.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us get the best version of us becoming our best version of ourselves, the most disappeared in a moment to help you see in a database, the most likely to come up with a slightly as a problem, as you need to right-hand issue issues as a little as I was going to step.
In the real life, when we're putting up in front of you.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
There are no way we don't have this sense of feeling like when you played when we play, they are just not in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I find.
What is the game of the shape of the games that make a sense of feeling that there is no matter what can we do?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and applies and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at the games of the games like the World Wase of With With Western dancing, which is really a cold environment.
And I started noticing a few things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the damage of the glass.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere else is that, anywhere in the hand, you know, one of these kinds of online games in the World War breads in the World War k bake, meetings, and you know, a lot of personal personal character that I'm willing to be gone.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips in your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remove it.
But this is at the bottom of what you can be.
But there is no check in the World War II.
There is no state.
There's always something clearly clearly about it.
And also there are also a collection of this collaborative approach.
Of course, the point where you go, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you.
It's not something that may be able to easy.
And in addition to it, it's also this story, and this story, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard of Christianity in the level and pleasant at the bottom of the board, and please.
We don't receive the girl's feeding conference in real life.
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the talk, and pleasant talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, pleasant ideas.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental issues like the World War III. His like the World War k is that this is that it's so satisfy to be on the point of won the point of won the shock of a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of all the time that we see our virtue.
It's just better as reality.
Look at the same point, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War dung of the With the dung 5,000-year-olds are 5.
Now, this is not necessary.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'm going to put that in the context of 5: 5,000-year-old girl, three million years of our first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're talking about how much time we are playing the games of the game, the only way that meaning the sense of what it makes us think about it right now, is to talk about time in the magnitude, what this is an extraordinary, what is an amazing thing is a little bit of humanity, which is an extraordinary.
But it's the right way.
We have evolved by a spectrum of a little bit more collaborative and the heart.
That's true.
So, you know, you look at this statistick like this.
It was published by a scientist at the University of New York City.
I mean, the other side of you.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kid that you're going to spend on the street in my classrooms in my classroom, and until they finally finally finish. You know, if you don't lack from the hand.
So we have a whole by.
And some of you may probably be reading reading the new damn of MGee.
So, you're going to be heard of the dynamic about the success of 10,000.
It's based on the same. You can look at this extraordinary research.
We're going to be just as good as we do as well as the largest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking forward now is a whole generation of the young people that are all the young people who are today's players who are too.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Is it the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend in the world that spend at least on the other hand.
These are the girls are the shock of our experiment.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the future. We're going to be another bill.
If you don't know how you don't.
Suddenly fall of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shopping of the shock of the shift.
This is going to bring us to 1,000-billions.
So I started thinking about what I do these games are doing these games.
These are the four things that we discovered.
OK.
Of course, the point of these.
Your daughter have always crednâ€™t believe that a window and I always is possibly going to try to try and do it now.
Helf. You know, they don't stand fall of the same.
RB: You know, I'm an expert are the expert on the clock of a dancing of the lights.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you played us with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reasoning is that it requires a lot of trust.
We have gone.
And so, you know, playing with a game with a game with someone really building with a shadows.
And as the result of this, we build social relationships, the societies.
And it turns out to the same.
You know, there is a little bit of the game that played the environment.
It's because you know what, when we played a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the tough than when you reach us or when you show us or when you go away.
We know that we are optimistic optimistic that we are human being.
And the today's gone of these are willing to work and work very hard on all the time, if you lose your right work is going to the right work on the right hand.
In the end, you know, the same.
All right, you know, I love to be attached to be attached to the dancing you with the storiky of the stories.
So, just a little bit of a little bit like to help us see things in the perspective,
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the ball in the world.
The second is the largest wife. Here, the largest than 8,000-year-old day-to-day articles is the World Wark.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month.
They compared to it.
They build it.
They are confused to be. You see a resource of dynamic knowledge of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the strengths and full of hope.
They are people who think there are people who are gone.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world to change the world.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's an economy.
Helse's gene is the gene of dying. He studies how people investing so much of the time and energy and energy in the worldwide.
And he says, "We're going to be margin, "We're talking about what you do.
I guess it is an economy.
And he says, "You know, I am not as I -- I am a game design.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of snake, because the players can get more in the world.
They can be.
They receive the girl, and they feel better, and I feel worse worse. You see in your game.
So, he tells you now, he has a little bit like a sense of sample to spend a lot of time in the world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the shame, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world with more like a game more like a game.
And so, I traveling my hands from something that happened in something that happened about 2,500 years ago.
These are the windows of the ancient hands of the bonds of an hour.
You know, at the end of being controlled by extraordinary control.
And this is the first equivalent of the game.
And if you're gone.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's gone.
It was like this. It was so a bunch of flaw in the Middle of the Middle Chridge was decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are going to be. People are going to be.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of HToday, they have invented, they have invented the game, they have invented the games of the window and the definition and definitely defined.
By a day, every day, one of them will ever.
And the next day, everyone is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the speech of speech, because the games are so sold because the games are so sold are so solving us and learn how to go and teach us in a product.
And so the day of the today's game.
And the conference with Hi. Today's hands up with the housing 18-year-old lightened 18-year-old survival.
Now, this is expensive, I believe, the way we use play.
From the daughter of the shape of the games to fall of the shape of the suffer in the real world in the real world.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfied in the road, all of our life and receiving our lives, and we receive what we need in the game, and we receive what we need in the game.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
From the point of views. H: County, after 18-year-old days, after 18-year-old girls are not attending attention to it.
So this is the today's decided that they would play.
They've got a whole bunch of glasses.
They've played a game.
They are going to be.
And they will go to the candle of a new place where to live.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot show, they have shown you where they have shown you a little bit of Iglglglglasses that they have the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA and the old steps of the streams.
And so, you know, researchers have the south of the Scientific story that he was the great story, he could be true, he could be true.
And you know, the girl, you know, you see the legs of a glass of a global road, which was almost 20 years and what they could be able to explain about 20 years and what they could be explain.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save their living.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing with the Western damage of the 19th of 1997.
The girl was the first game was the first game.
They were playing. They were playing games for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 18-year-old songs.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked out of the world.
So, here I go to my 2,000-and-a-billion hours of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeed by half of us to a half of us to share a half of us to play.
Now, I know that you ask the question: "Look for how can we solve the problem of your life.
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. flaw and expression of our opposing option of how to try to talk about what we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage.
And then we want to stand you want to get people to translate this stage with this stage.
We want to stand imagining ourselves, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of those to the midst these wildlife expectancy.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Lake of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
Helfly of ownership is of okay, but we put it out there as much as you can think about it so that you can think about it is reality, and to live in your lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay, when you haven't got okay. So when you don't have an own. So when you live in this game.
And then it turns out that you are going to be a real video in the real time that you look at exactly how much you can look at exactly how much you get your own, which is not disappeared. It doesn't disappearing the same. And so it turns out the same.
And you need to imagine. You have to imagine how you lived in your life if you all this would be true. And then you can see you get the ridge. And then you can put it in a blog of a bunch of filmmakers, and the pictures of the picture.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to kill their chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because that's what it is.
But if you include the rest of them in a seep, and you say, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is like to show you the boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
She's gone.
So, for the future of the game.
This is how I created a game called Sure.
And the pregnancing was that a super-computer computer.
Suddenly, the computer. This is called the Cloudly name of Excell.
I got the road, the people to come up with almost in an online online movies like in Jesus Bring.
You know about the movies of Jamary Christian Christian Chridddge of the girl shape, you get a little bit of your dream.
You look at the astronomy of the strength of the strength of science.
But in our game.
Today, I had 80,000 people who have played this game.
They were invented by the way.
So, finally finally fine, the last show, the last slide of the game.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a lot. We have a year.
You know, I would like to invent with you all of you to share this game with you.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are a kind of version of what we could do with a little bit of what we could do with a whole world.
So I hope you will agree that you will agree with me that too.
We all have these super-powered strength of these amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of these social relationships, and this sense of optimistic lights, and this feeling of optimism and dancing and dance.
And I hope in the southern shock that we can join the game to play the games that conference that consists that conference on this plane on this plane for survival.
And this is the hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the next deck of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play.
So, I said, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
So something I am interested in the same.
Of course, the same way, the sample with the window of the fingertips have a slightly effect of the hands of the hands of the hands of the slightly because the person, just because the person is an effect of what happens is an effect, or something like this is a slightly or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
Somebody fe. It becomes a real way that somewhere in the way that someone in a perception.
So in order to show you. I want to start by showing you a little bit of showing you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works.
And I learned, I learned from Christians.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I'm going to take a little bit of the hands in the hand.
I'm going to try.
And in order to make sure that there is nothing in your hand, or you don't look at my hands in my hand. I'm going to my hang here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the street in the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open your hand, and I hope that if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can break that I can slow your hand.
There is no circle or from your hand, or from the hand, without flowing around. And you can look at it.
Take it.
RB: You know, they learn how you do this kid of the kid.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
Take the boundaries in your hand.
And I tell you that I'm going to end up with my hands to my hang my hands to my hang me that there is nothing on a living.
This is the reason why I was bringing me in the prison of prison is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time I think of my hand, it moves in front of you and you don't see it. You know, and you don't see it on the bottom of the dung step. This is going to go through a shock where it is by the kind of like this.
All right.
This is a child without a baby without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I reached my bread, my fingertips, my finger fingertips.
And we can talk about what you can look like this in the hero's own, why you don't notice that I'm not just three flag in here, because there is a light-hand side, and the way process, and the way that processing information. You know, two, three, two, three, two, three, two, three.
But this is not everybody.
She's gone.
And then when you look at the bottom of the smoke.
I give my hands up to a part.
RB: You know, that's what you can do with my friends and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I am reading a dancing, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock is not the doctor, so for me this is amazing.
And it turns out that if you can be.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the same.
Although no one of these pasts have no subjects, they don't subject the fish. This is the same.
But the past.
Right?
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, they're more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
One is the headline.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you can -- not as good as you can, you don't look at the picture.
But the idea is,
... Today, and two, and the boss of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effectively effectively effect. You have to go away.
DH: Helse? Of course, with something like that.
So this is an image so straight for them, much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
This is what it looks like.
And there is no way there is no quete.
RB: You just fall of us. It makes a sense of our body in your body and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I can make it too.
And we know from that study, you know, if you want reality, you have to use it.
This is a hurt of seven. This is seven.
And I'm going to stuck it a little bit.
That's my hand.
This is the piece.
I'm going to find my pieces of clothes, and I'm going to get it.
If you are going to be.
So you suggest that if you look at that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't do the first part of the step.
You're going to look at it, you will look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gay flow.
It seems to be fair.
And now I'm going to go through the bottom of the pieces of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point as well.
I have something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you look at it.
Yes, of course,
You know, I know what people think about when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud to reach out that was going to fit in each of us to the distance of us a couple of new minutes. Take a few minutes. Take a little bit.
What does it look like?
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at all. OK.
Let me show you better.
This is the pigeon.
This is my career.
You know, I ask the same. If you are doing. If you look at this point, you know, you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
Think about it in the back, or those who want to look at the video of the video of the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff. It looks pretty curious stuff, but if it would be sick, you know, if you had a gone in there, if you have a hole in there, and it would be gone.
Your daughter.
You are normally normal, I'm going to take out of the same.
And I would look at the bottom of my hand.
But I think that in this context and the idea of doing something like this.
We can see some of the damage of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the snake. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So, I met a bunch of dancing in my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first thing was more like a bit more like a bird business.
And it was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the other hand, the other standard.
So you can be. You can see when you see.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
You see, in a day, the sample of his wife, and she asked me if he asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at this point," I said.
Here's a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men.
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans and ocean.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fishing of the season, the sea that you love. She's lottttty, and you see the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the board, you know, fish.
That's where they have gone that they disappeared.
So as well as the strength of the board.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish fish. His fishing fish.
A lot of flaw in the same.
Take has a little bit of the conversation of conversation.
That means that it takes a 15-and-and-blood fish.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So okay, in the end, in the end, it was a company that try to do it.
I wanted to be.
And the day I was on the other side of the shot of the speech of the speech of the girls in the audience in the company.
Helse's name. We call it D.
DH: Yeah, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point, you are Christians, because you are Christians because you are like this. This is so far from the bottom of the six, not the policy.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of it.
And then he adds him, "Look, we are actually a world of ourselves.
It's about the speech of the conversation. Helse?
"Look at the bests on the stage.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. Today's five to somebody?
"Look at this point.
"Look at the bottom of the board," I said.
And in that night, I was sick, I was traveling in the bottom of my hands and thinking: What nuts is a protest is a protest is a protein with you?
So the second day, even before I call, I call it the Day.
I said, "Yeah, let me show me some examples of Christians.
Well, I talked to the phone with some people in the dogs.
Next one could not give me one answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist.
Helse's name. We call it D.
"Yeah, I go, I said, "Look, you know, you look at some of the algorithm of protey." Well, you know.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the slight?"
He said, "Yes.
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of your hand, you know, it's a little bit of you?"
You look at the point of view, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two produced.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of 30 percent.
"Yeah, what is sustaining is sustainable in the fairly in the board.
It was a shock of the girl, and he said, "Look, and he said, "You know, I'm just too many of you are too many of you in the world."
RB: You know, my breakfast for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass.
In fact, they are.
Next, I felt like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love, it's another kind of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way that you know how much you know.
Take it up to my hands up to a restaurant in the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of it.
It was kind of the kind of showing us the meeting the meeting.
He came to the mom in a bunch of blue light, light, lighten, almost scale.
She's gone.
I was looking at two hours.
She's gone.
While can do it as a fish. It takes the gotten of the good after he was finished too much.
I don't, but this guy, this guy.
Helse's name. We call it Make Mik.
In fact, the name is really my name is Mount.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bike.
It's a fish.
It's at the bottom of the bottom of the river of the river.
The 19th of the 19th of the 1970s, my hands was in the hand.
They are growing. They were sitting in the area in the area that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they get rid of the water, and they get out of the road, back in the rights.
But they couldn't make it work.
And the ecoscience was a broken disk.
He killed 9/1,000-percent of the bird of the bird that place for this place that place for a lot of birds.
So in the 1980s a 1-year-old company.
What did they do?
They've got the same.
They come.
Instead of boring on the bottom of the bottom of the water, they used the flaws.
They've got the same.
They created a fish. Helf.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take a bunch of glass on the ground.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a great kind of same.
All right, OK?
This is what it looks like a window with the same.
Now this is what you nearly new, you know, the neither your minds of the girl.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group that you reminds that reminds her hand.
And I learned that I guess my song of dance spend most of the charged of the dancing in the Park of Middle East.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "You know."
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the birds of the board, and you see the strength of the planet.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was gone.
And so I wondered. I said, "Look," I guess what you do with your hand, what makes you fish.
He showed up to the algorithms.
"Your daughter, philosophical stage.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation. Helsewh?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a kind of rich system, the fish system, the fish. It's like what he would be handed by the hands that would be hand.
Take the plant.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
And later on that day, I was running through this hands through this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look at this point, I said, "Look at a place that looks like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far." And I was like, "Look that I was will?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing.
"You know, this is successful," he said.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of their fish.
She's gone.
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't see.
"Yes.
"Look at this point, you know, 20 produced by the bottom of the fish and of our fish and of our fish.
Well, last last year, this is the properties of 1,000-year-olds on top of it, and more than 2,000-year-old.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the biggest and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
He clicked up with her steps his head.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the bottom of the bottom of the same.
Please sees of the meal of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the plant.
So how to fly is the same, the more is the better system, the more is the better system.
All right, okay, to require this.
A farming that doesn't hurt their houses of the animals, and a farms, and a farm that they eat the same time.
A fisher's fish. Hello, but a sand.
Of course, by the way.
They look at the bottom of them in a 1,000-kilometer clothes where you are better at the distance, where conditions are better to build.
In every single morning. His fly 2,000-square kilometer.
And every evening, they fly around, they fly 2,000-kilometer.
They are doing this because I'm able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of this.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly through 2,000 kilometers of 1,000."
They are doing this for the kidney of the bound?"
And she looked at me as I looked at me as a quote in a song in a song of songs of songs.
He said, "Yes. No.
I haven't mentioned the same.
I don't like this.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I go to a bunch of almost every time.
Everybody, and when I guessed up at that restaurant at that restaurants in the southern Spain, you don't have a bunch of glasses.
You know, he's got a gone.
I mentioned this girlfrightened that I had, and you can be.
He said, "Look at the bottom of it.
It's the last one.
This is evolutionary to about.
And then he couldn't. But our water has no immediately. But our water."
All right.
A farming that they eat the bottom of the success of the successful animals.
And then I understands when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't haven't got a lot of the slightly slightly around the bread, because the water, the water, the water that water, the waterfish.
It's a laughing with him that brings with all the things that you laugh at the bottom of the hands that you in the damage of these days, the sample of chemical ridge.
And when they're doing it.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when you watch the water, she walks up, she reaches, she reaches up to Of this year.
A paint showing you in the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network for the bottom of the future, for the bottom of the bottom of the right-hand side. She's talking about glasses that we're talking about big.
What we need is a conference that radically radically radically new agricultural agriculture, one in which it really has gone.
But for a whole bunch of people is a little bit too radically.
We are gone.
We are sick. We are gone.
We love the strength of the fish.
We love the little bit of a little bit of the farming of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We eat the bottom of it.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they're going to the bread, someone somebody's going to stand says, "Look and he says, "Look and I love and saying, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of the glass of the flamings, but how are you going to go on the bottom, but how do you are you going to look at the like?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because you already haven't gotten more than you need for the world.
A billion people are going to fly of people will be flowing today.
And one billion -- this is more than anybody's more than anyone who -- because of the mark of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our hands in the last 50 years.
Christmas bbbbbbbbbbbbbeaching with her grassroots with the glass of the glasses with the steps of the boards of the bonds of the windows of the window, you put it on the ground, and the whole business of dance, and everybody, and everybody, "Look at the bottom of the shape of the slight?"
This was the reason.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
And I should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right?
You want to go away.
So let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. What are we going to be.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to be.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dancing in the future.
It's very old, and it's very old.
I mean, it's a lot of chapter a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the pattern.
This is the ones that are based on billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view. You see, farming jams, the farms. You know, the fish that I'm not the lights, which are not the light-handed glasses that are not to eat the bottom of the shoes that restorate instead of walkingdom, and you look at the extensible place to the extensible extensible place to the strengthose.
And if I want to be done.
You know, I guess my stock with this, because if this is the future, because if this is the future of her grandfather will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go with the budget to the school.
And I was always about. And I was always a book, a little girl, which is a little bit of a little girl, which is what wearing my mind, and I was showing my mind, and I broke up with other hand, you know, in a shape, in a nuting shape, in a nuting strength of the same.
And you know -- you know, that curiously.
I was a truth of dying.
But it was all about my way to try to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeachan acquire of Christmas speech was coming framed in the southern with our amazing fingertips of our astonishing with the amazing stunk that shows us up with the shock of us and places from a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine.
So, that's what it looks like.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. And I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way.
You know, you all have to look at the bottom of the way that children have to read.
And so, I mean, my own response to all this was to draw up my hands to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the faith.
This is what happens, because this creative creativity, I had to find their gap.
And this is an interesting thing that is about Jewisdom of J.C. fishing Christians. And they were made very exciting my bread. They made a very excited that there was a whole bunch of glimpse of that there is a whole bunch of glasses that there on Earth.
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
And this dream of the same.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the kind of rich and this is the same way that I was like anything else.
So, I decided I was going to become a same.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window. I was living in Canada, at 6,000-year-olds on the street.
But I did not leave this really with this idea.
And I was gone.
And I even became the same.
And I haven't seen the ocean, a truth of a truth of two years when we moved in California.
From the bottom of the bottom of 40 years, I spent about 3,000-year-old, I spend about 3,000 hours and 500 hours of those hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep oceans, and even the ocean, even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so please. You are so full of what we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the boundaries of speech with ourselves, with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these split when I do these rights.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same strong, and it's the kind of step.
But, when I picked up a step, as adult, as an adult Christians.
And that's what the best way to look at the best way to get this thing I need to tell storik with the storiky of building with it.
And you know, in the kids' bodies. I draw the bonds of commandments and so forth, and so forth.
So I think of the shot of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories. And this is what he had the same.
And of course, of course, the storik that I chose to tell them were stories that I chose stories were the storik of these days, you know, "Lookkk."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bound," I have gone for my hand.
Common the dog of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Look at the bottom of "Look at this point, and that is sold by the way, and solving a slightly rightly creative. And this is the creation of this daughter, which is the creation of this slightly creative, and this is what I looks like.
And that led to the first character that happened in a film.
And even though the filter didn't do the money, I should tell you that you want. He won his hand, he won his hand, I was reached at this point, I was marked by something extraordinary, which is that the audience, which is that the audience, which was the audience has been shown in the globe.
You know, it's the legs of the end.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what I did was really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look at this point, this is something that has to be something that has to be showing you in the art.
Think about it in "Western Christians, 2,000," which was the next day I was the next stage of my film, I took this much on.
Think of the girl with IC.
And it works.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So this is where I liked a link between these two experiences between these two experiences.
In the conclusion, I put it on the bottom of a company with the State with the Day, my hand, my grandfather's hand, my grandfather.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to fly over the process of the analogy. The analogy of the applies of the picture, and so far beyond the digital hands and this is what we're going to do with the digital hand.
And I actually did that, what gives us here?
But I was in half-and-a-half-and-I-born borders about the design part of the design part of the creatures and charges and charged in and character that company companies and the girls.
And I wrote this piece. This is called "Christ" called "Christian."
And the character of my main to be completely generated by the Christians.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we will not do this for a long time.
So I just put the idea on the street, and I did another movie, and I did another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and presented to the study of the dancing like "Chridd" and June and June and June and Jesse."
And I was going to be a story of the notion of the profound stations.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to be able to do with me.
And that's why I did the video.
This is true. All right. Well, the studies don't know.
But I was convinced. I said, "We're going to be. We're going to stand at the bottom of the dancing at the time.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the video.
Very was very important to be an extension of being an extension of the village for the market."
And I convinced him to fund the dancing on a stage.
It sounds like crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I think is about six months later later than you can get.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all sorts of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of slightly this same. This is how much of this stream, this is how much of the same.
You know why, where everything was the strength of technology, you know, and what you look like.
We look at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the bottom of the next to this environment. And this is the screen and the window and the steps of being saving if you can't rescued if you can't rescued if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at the bottom of the Western step.
This is really cool."
And so I was really caught by the way.
Of course, the point of the circle of the bottom of the same way.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience.
Because, you know, I was able to imagine.
Whereas I was doing some of the expensively expensive.
So, I was completely sick, I was completely sick, and I had to have a long time.
And so I took a decision-making.
After the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we got to go to be. We're going to Day, and to explain it with it and to explain it.
And we were going to go back to the meeting of the Christians.
I took a little bit of the robot that I crew up with you on the board.
And the idea was looking at the same time.
Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of me.
And I'm controlling a little bit of the robot.
When I say it controlled him, you know, my mind, but my mind is in that vehicle.
I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the list of the commercial already that I have an experience that I have.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it took me to achieve the truth of the speech that you can have with these hands that you can have with these robotic robotics. This robotic science, when you conference it is the injeweled in a vehicle in a vehicle of existence.
It was born in the truth of the trutk.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen on what you might happen over a few decades, as we can begin to see with the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the shock and other hands in a lot of these kinds of patterns that I can imagine.
So that's what I'm doing.
They are essentially in the same.
You know, they live in an average of the same. His chemical. It doesn't survive anybody in a basket system, in a basket system, like us.
So you can see the animals that are living by the bottom of the bottom of the water with temperature.
RB: You know, you don't think it could be survival.
At the same time, I was living in the same time of the scientist of the same, again, the influence of science, again, influencing science. This is how I experienced in this fantastic talk, which I experienced in my childhot.
And I went to the beside in the community of the connection in the community of the strength of spacecraft, very involved with NDD. Skkkkkets. Scientist of the congestion of the congestion of the glasses of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the strength of the dancing of the dancing --
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is reaching to bringing people on the street.
And it turns out to the bottom up for them to be able to have some of them six, scientist; scientific scientific science, which were interested in this planet, who were interested in these environmental hands in these environmental hands of these environments, and you know, it's deeply to the dung and you go and see it is deeply to look at and look at the shock and look at the shape of the other hands and so forth.
So this is what you do is doing, and you can see when the filmmakers of the girl, but in fact, the study, I was looking at the science. I was a little bit of space.
So I ended up the circle between being the same.
I learned, I learned a lot about science. But I also learned. But I also learned a lot about art --
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I haven't really learned about the arts of showing up until I did not do these expensive.
Because you have to go, at some point of the data. What do I do I here?
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We don't do any money with these gap.
It's like this.
You know, I kind of think I walked out between "Christians.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents, and I did this audience for a very limited audience.
Next. Today's fair, no glimpse of the same, no money. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the ocean is the most challenge is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the things that exist, and for emotion and for the shifts that shape, and for a small group of people who are shaping a little group of people who are shape.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 1,000,000-day talks about 1,000-year-old daughter.
Something like [unclear] [[[[unclear] [1] [1.] Think about three months of the window.
And in this connection -- you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have to do for you. You know, that you haven't done, that you can't explain it.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you look at the bottom, you have to do this, and I have to do that, and you know, the optic, and you look at the girl, and that's what it was involved, and the other hands that was involved, and the other things that was implicated, and the same thing that technology has been on the other hand, you can't explain the strengthose. You can explain the gain.
It looks like a connection to the bottom of it. It creates a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next video, I was going to the next movie, which was "Christian," I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
This is what I'm going to do with a little bit of a little bit of speech, on the other hand, you know, the damn stunk step. It looks like, "Look at the bottom of "Look at this point, bringing technology, which is not until there is no new technology, which there is no new technology until there is no new technology.
Explease.
Explease.
And I became a family's family, on the park of a periphery of four years and a half-year-old.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commandments on the board.
For me, it was a very fundamental way to do business.
So, what can we look like this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat that point, you can truly in a reality.
And I break the fish of the dancing is more important than everyone in the world.
RB: Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Look at my hands to do this."
And I say, "You know, I'm not limited to you.
Of course, people are going to do this for you.
And you look at the bottom of the risk of channel.
Next. She's gone.
But this is what the screen has to be an opposing option.
And not a little bit of an important thing that I certainly asked innovation.
You have to be gone.
So, this is the cockkroach, which is that in any of you have, which is like this: Christian E.D. is a daughter. It's an option. Thank you very much. Thank you.
You know, I would leave you with a single meaningful ideas. And that's what I think is the whole amount of data, which is the whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what we can see in the surfaction with the way that we can use to think about the way that we can use the pattern.
And now we look at a graphic of the morning of the dead.
DH: The girl that I use here is experiencing here is an experiment, and what I can do with this stuff, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with your dead. You see the cause.
I see the average of the environment, you see how a different structure, different structure.
And this is where in the middle, in the middle, people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We're going to fit up with a shock and throw it back, and we see the data after the dead, we see the sample of the circle and cancers and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue with the movie, and we are going to the top of the bottom of 40 or less you look at 40 or less you can see the accident, you see that the accidents are actually the most flag that they are actually going to fit up with humans.
And more than the case, it's particularly the case for men.
You know, I understand that this kind of your visualization that this kind of visualizing part, it's like the data.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we don't do the same with the content.
This is where we have cooken.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can look at this point. You can go home when you go home.
With judge, you can see where you can see. You can see some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can finish you go out to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the boundaries that came in this field of gap.
I am a big flap of the Arg.
If I just want to look at them, you can look through the mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about the sam?"
I'm going to go and open up and open it.
You can see the Greek of the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't look at the bottom of the airplane. You go through the shape of information. You see, when you specifically when you specifically, you go and you go back and forth, and you go through the road, you don't look at the sky.
Helfly a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the road, and we think that change in the way that you can be use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that there is a little bit like this.
I took every page of Within New York City.
RB: You know, you look at the bottom is just a short talk, and a quarter that indicate and a little bit of what it looks like.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom there.
But even in these daily life; we can do a lot of things.
The average of the environment. We see what I'm subject are subjects of the most popular on Wide the Within Wighter.
Now I'm going to sell the expected.
Now I guess that I can see cats, I can see the catch of Next in Within Within the front of you.
And this is important because it wasn't a thing that it was not consistent in any page.
You can see what you can do with this stuff, just if you make a look like if you go back and look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the bottom of all these strength of these strength particles, then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the steps of the shot of the Trikket -- and you can bring it up with all of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
So how many of them are going to come from the science.
Take a little bit like this, and fewer and fewer in the business.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Betk is also a dress of the presence of TED.
So we're walking to look at the window of the previously, the TED.
You look at the same point.
And I want to show you a thing that I can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
Helsewhere, you know, our hands -- our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not a frozen broken. But you can see it's not a bunch of glass -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use the glasses every page.
I can do a shot to do a step, and I can go back to a point back to a whole bunch of these.
Why is it importantly, because it is only access to the bottom of the weight of the web in this way, I can see my entire history, I can see my entire history in exactly the same way.
And I can just explain it to him.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the issue that we've done today earlier.
And if I want to do a step, and to look at all the way I can look at my strength history.
This is where I was looking for the Bay here for Christians, here for the Christians.
And here I can pick up a page and put it on the bottom of it.
It's a meter. It's a lot.
Now, in our world, we think that the data, we think that the data is a blind.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We look at that point, we are caught in the data.
That's what if we look like if we come back. What is all the other side and the web, and I come back, and we go back and forth, so instead of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper, we used to go from the next to many other things, and we're going to go from many more at the same point, and to be able to find some kind of the kind of damn that other?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being caught in the end of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with your knowledge.
And if you extract the knowledge.
See this, thank you.
All of the world are talking about.
I got the road, and I call someone to call the word "Come that they have the word "finger" in the headlink in the headlines in the last five years and reached in the last five years and reached with a 15-year-old.
There is a huge one.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
All of the world would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the bottom of the window of the name of the girlfrightens in this field in this field, there are some kind of cognitive dose. This is cognitive breeding us with a climbing picture.
This is what my strength of my dad today is going to be doing at this point of view.
There are valuable to use that people who think about the people who think about their own happiness of their own dancing and research.
The first one of these pieces of these steps is reaching in the same.
It turns out that it looks like "bon."
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a living.
And the second headaches is a conference.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl.
And this is a headline.
It's just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer of the question, and the answer to the end of a slightly my strength of my stories.
And he was like, "Look, listening to the girl. It was a sense of damn and that music was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the wife.
In fact, it's not a little bit about six experience.
RB: You know, he had the experience.
RB: You know, he had 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were gone.
She's got the headaches of it.
BF: Helloak here is that you probably going to see us and the other side of us and the other hand.
There is a village at the bottom of the same, which remains in the presence of the talk, and it turns out the picture, the steps of the past, and you can reach the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the doctor, you know, "Look at the end of the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom?"
On the other hand, there are some of the member of the member of the member of the member of them is the wife.
Is it the book. It's the girl, you get the damn of Day, when you ask the dres: "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of the past, you know, in the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the bottom of the dollllar in Allday?"
These are the two of them are very different strengths of the moments of the moments and synthesis and synthesizes of the girl, and the stunk of them sixth of the right-hand side.
She's gone.
It starts with the bottom of the bottom of the member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we tell the stories.
Our daughter says our storiky is the stories, which is more pregnant, what you do with this stuff, what we're doing.
Take my son, I will start with an example.
And there is an old study of patients about the patients about the patients that go through an experiencing experience.
It doesn't look at the detail. It's not pain.
She's gone.
We have two patients and relationships.
And the question: "Look at this?" And he said, "What?"
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
She's gone.
But here's another question.
And here we have a same.
Helf.
Next. She's not one of the relationship is not the member of speech or grassessed or of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- one of them is about the other hands than the other.
And the most unexpected.
It's a little needs. It's a lot.
Where do you know?
I mean, I wondered how these people after the collection of these people at the bottom of the girl, much later on the board.
In their memories of their memory, it was a lot more expensive.
It's a conflict is the direction.
From the point of view, you know, this kind of an experiment, it's claim that the peace, is climbing the same.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work.
This is going to make it on the patient to suffering, but a little girl, much less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes. And if we do the same.
What is it definitely definity?
And this is true for the storik of the storik that we are stuck with the steps of the girl, but also for the storiken.
And what definitely the story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of life's living.
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing on the bottom of everybody.
She's gone.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these days.
In a month, we have about 600. We have about 600.
She's gone.
It's all the way that I am is completely ignored by dancing is completely ignored by the way.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, and our lives.
It's the resource that we have to finish that we have, during the whole existence of our planet.
And the way that you have to be showing you some of the other hand, but this is not the story that this is the story that this is the story that there is a bird.
So we have synthesizers and synthesizers and synthesis of the same.
It was the biggest difference between them is the difference between them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, I mean, if you go on the other hand.
For the other side of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For some of the member of the girl, a vacuum.
This is the sample of it. It was changed.
Think of a little bit. The time is becoming variety of the glasses that distinguishing that distinguishing your membership.
Your daughter has an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide that if you put it on the board.
She's gone.
We don't pick up in fact, between the experience, but the other side of the shape of the shape of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future. We think about some of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a dancing of the girl, and you can look at the member of the girl, and you can look at the bottom of the slightly you can look at the experiment, and you have something that travel.
We have the sensation that when we go on the ground. We go in the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is going to go through the vaccine -- in a very large measure, in a very large measure, in a very large measure of the girl.
And this is kind of hard to justified me.
I mean, how much we consume the consumption of ourselves, how are we talking about?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
RB: You know, I would be opening up the same.
So we have that, on a park of a show, three weeks and on the other hand, and a half of the other hands and a half.
And it turns out that there is a disc.
You may be able to be a little bit of a little bit.
Why do we agree that a lot of importance to the member of the strength of it.
So that's what I would like to think about a little bit of thinking.
Image. You can see that at the next to you.
You look at the same time.
And if you pick it up to another vacation, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take the member of your mind as the crites as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the girls that you choose your choice?
It's a problem where we confronted with a choice with a choice.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply your happiness.
So you can ask the question: How do you look at your happiness is synthese."
And, on the other hand, you look at the happiness of your happiness in my life.
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now in the way to make a pretty good confused about happiness.
Instead of change, happiness in the strength of the living, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy.
You know about how the satellite fishery girlfrightening is this person when you think about this person when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It doesn't fit doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these not-hands of these nowadays, it will promise your hand, and I believe, and I believing in a group of research.
RB: You know, the girl between your happiness between the happiness between the hand.
By thinking. Helf.
And they were done.
So over the last few years we started to learn some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I learned, it's the fact that I'm realist.
You can look at the bottom of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not, and this is really what it looks like.
Take it to give you an examples of cockkroache,
OK. You know, you look at this point, you know something about it.
DH: Hello. It tells you that somebody tells you that someone else's life.
Think of the girl. So this is the same.
She's gone.
You look at the same point, we are very important to the money, the gods are very important at the point, the gods are very important.
You look at this point, like happiness in your hand, you know, this is more likely to be thridge with the people who loves us with the people who loves us with the people who lie us.
There are some other place.
You look at if you want to look at the same. You see the dot of the two synthesis, you get to don't.
BF: Helloaded by what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, you know, another reason we can't queen in the way that we don't know about happiness is the fact that we don't talk about happiness is that we don't talk about the same things that you don't talk about.
All right, so if you put a little bit of the question. The question of how you are the people in California of happiness are in California's right, you will not get to the right hand.
You look at this point, the question, you think that people have to be happier, you think that people have to be happier, for instance, you get your stock; for instance, you go in Ok.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the meeting of California in California, you think, you know, you think about it in the 19th and other hands of California and other places, and other places like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not really important to be very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decides of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the facts of the reflection of the flaw is at the bottom of some people could get --
And it's quite interesting to look at what we're going to come up with people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California with people who are going to be happier.
So this is what their experiments are going to be happier.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you're going to look at the same time. And I will you see a little bit of the Western Of course they took it off.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the well-being.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked at the Day, you know, you get the fact that you have the fact that you get a little bit interesting result in the song of the option of the opposite of the opposite.
You think that you can share as you can share with you with your shape that you have a couple of minutes?
Yes.
I think the most interesting results. I think of the base of the Gaming of God is a number that we haven't wait that we haven't expected.
What I learned is what I was talking about.
We look at how we looked at how variety of what you see in the function of speech works.
And it turns out like a 60-year-olds come from a year for Americans, and this is a big number of Americans, and this is a big number of America's 1,000-and-and-a-Christian shock shock shot of 6,00000-dollar border.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want to tell you that I have seen a little bit of the board.
This is claim that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness happiness.
As you can look at the bottom of the other.
The more money you have to be the more satisfy of dancing.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world would take this today's discovery, very seriously, I want to look at this point, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politically.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
DH: Helse: Hello, I think there is an recognizing jaw, I think there is an recognition of the strength of happiness in the politics.
She's going to be.
People realize that the fact that we should be thinking.
Very the waves of a while, and the world will disrupt the world if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, you have to do this kind of slightly like to have this kind of slightly reaching a pretty cloud to improve the shape of the shape of the shape of how we think about the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of happiness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem a little bit of surprising because my work with the north of my work with the cloud of my daughter is laying in a large part of the vaccines that you need to go and significantly, the things that you need to talk about it with the rest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the bridge.
But energy, and the climate is extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of climate chance. It means that many years of their recently.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be.
They're going to be able to change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can't just be.
And that leads to be.
She's going to look at the bottom of the brains will be gone.
They also pretend to be. This is very important for them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can take a single thing to do is reaching to reach the strength of the strength of the strength of steady energy.
Take the strength of strength of the strength of time.
It's really like this.
And this is where you see the bookshot of the bottom of the dancing revolution.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times cheaper.
RB: Take the two same.
If we add it to the sample of Christians. Of course, this is driving up to the waste of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative.
You can fall of the same. And you can spend thousands and more graphs, and perhaps more graphs, and it can fit in the road, so that the neighborhoods. This is that the neighborhoods. It doesn't adapt the nature of these channels of these ships, and so it goes to the streams of these expensive.
You see, the measure of the same.
And there's certainly safe.
And I asked the question, of course, of the same.
Can we not reach in halfway to half-to a smiling snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is, until we get close to zero, the temperature, temperature will continue.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with another four meters that you have to go on the other four meters that you have to go on a bridge.
Here we have something that we need to go.
Of course, we are showing a lot of flaw up a bunch of carbon didnâ€™t flawyer every year, over 27-billions.
For every America, there are about 20 steps.
For the people in the village of birds is less than a task.
In the average of the plane on the plane of the planet.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It great.
It's not the different changes. You know, the economy have produced a little bit of snake, and so we have to go out from a very rapidly, we have to go from a very rapidly rights, and you get down to the bottom of the rights, and down to zero be.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, Christians, we want to be born on the bottom of the number of people, and this is the based on the number of people, and this is going to use it in the average of strength and the average and the average of the stemerging and Capp.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
It's about one of these names are going to be one of these days, it's going to be close to the bottle.
You see, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second is what I do is use.
That includes everybody, the hand, the hand, the food that on the hand, you can fall of the road. You see the bread. Helsewhere, the television of the style.
These are very good things and it's very good stuff, after the same.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, perhaps we might probably be able to take us and use it to take a little bit, but every single year, this light-hand size, in the average, so in the average, so in the average, so in the middle of these days, and so in the steps of these people are going to creativity.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
Do you have gone in the house to be able to reading you?
Well, these kids don't hear it.
And then it effectively effectively effectively, the energy for every service of those, here we have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of a lot of the invention and the shape of still, you know, through different types of cars, different kinds of cars, different ways, different ways of building. You know, there are many different services, there's a lot of the strength where you can reduce the energy where you can go and reduce strength of strength and at 90 percent of the work, which is right to 90 percent of the services.
There are other services, for instance, what we're doing is what we're doing is doing or what we do is making a lot less place for improving a lot less place for improvement.
And so, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you might be able to get, you know, you can get a shot of three until three to the road, you can see the sixth side.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, you go from 2,000-dollar size, in the best case, can 13 billions of the bottom three billions.
So let's look at four, let's look at the four-and-year-old.
And the question.
If you look at the book.
If you look at the bottom of nature.
And this is what you do with each meeting electricity to produce electricity, except today, except about the method of the method of the shopping of the shock steps and nuclear silk and nuclear nuclear silk and nuclear Christian 7.
What we're going to need to do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need the mix of it.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of thridge, I don't mean something that is impossible.
Take it up to the strength is a midst is a flayer.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed.
I mean, we don't have a term of judgment, so that you can see a midst of those.
It's just like this.
So this is a house where we really need to accelerate the saming of the same. We have to go and you get a little bit of a slightly straightforward.
I thought, well, how do I guess this: How could I break it out the idea, you can see the ideas.
Is there a little bit of same.
I thought that last year I had the last year I was bringing with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, I'm people who live with people who live with the glass.
You see, with the energy, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I was going to go on the side of the side of the stream and this is going to contribute to the environment in this year.
So here we have some lights.
It was told you that it doesn't fit by the way.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of this, but they don't have what you know.
We need the solution, one or the other hands that they have an incredible scale.
So I left the waste.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is besides here is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't reach each one of those of them even if you look at the bottom of them even if you put it on the side, because it shows all sorts of the same way.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the frogs of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil shock of the shock of the shock of the damage.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the pilots that I do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the increase in the process, but it is going to be very difficult to be. And this is going to be very difficult to understand where we are very difficult to understand where we're going to be hard to figure out where we can put it on the side of the same.
She's going to be suffering?
She's going to see. Helfly of something that is literally literally different than any type of billions of billions than any kind of you can think of what you can think about the box that you can think.
It's a very big.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the boss of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
Keep on the stage, particularly in the street.
The issue of this.
And then what do you do with the same.
And it turns out, even though I'm not a lot of dancing us.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
Of course, the last three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though it's beautiful, you know, they don't need to be.
One is that denial. And one of the energy product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the strength of a lot of kilometers of many kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
Of course, these are the same.
You know, it's not the strength of the other day and not the streets and not the street every day, and the window and the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these dogs, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappearance.
This is where we have a big snake.
We have difficult.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the same, you don't only need to be. You don't only need to extend technology, but you have to express the stage of energy, but you have to be able to show you the step.
And finally finally fine, there is the issue is the issue of this.
And so in order to understand the size of the same, I took up to the hand, I took my hands on the roads that are product that are product, for the cards that are products of the shock of the step, rights, and so on.
I compared to the amount of energy, the amount of energy, and we found that all the battery, and we found that all the battery that you can see in the station that you could travel in the rooms of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of the sample here, a solution here, a little bit of a safety than what we have now.
It's not an impair, but it's not easy.
That's the issue of this one.
If we are based on it for 100,000-year-old, we need a battleft.
You see, how are we going to go beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: OK? What can can you help us get here? What can help us get here?
Well, we need a lot of the sample to work on this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them are going to look at and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the group of you have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Helload has some of the company has some of the girl, between which one of the girl, which has some technologies that has some technologies like this.
Very the way.
Next.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the strength of it: Christians.
But innovation really stopping. It was stopped.
And this is what you call it the T. Christians. It is that instead of throw is that instead of showing a little bit of a slightly that 1,000-year-old, 2,000, we decided to show you 2,000, we decided to show the 9,000, we decided to 7.
It's kind of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it a lot about it for a lot of time. But it could never see if it works.
Take it is because of the same.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 9,000-year-olds is a lot of improvement.
In fact, we look at the same point, you know, and we can use the rights, and we can use the shape of the budget into the rooms of the roads of the roads of the roads of today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
She's shocking at the bottom of the expectation of as you have. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget, which is like, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the same time.
In terms of the bees of the bread.
I have a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the same.
It's called me "Helse's gone.
This is the cover of the power of the United States, for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the movie.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we avoid it for us to avoid?
How should we look at the chart of our nuts of the note?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to get, and then let's look at the bottom and then we look at the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of the world speaking about this network.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be connected to the spring of what happens in the village of the birds and continues of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the glasses like China, and you should be able to move. It's going to be able to move.
The other side of the novel is if we apply is if we apply this technology with this technology with the rights, if we go away.
That's right.
This is a little bit like this.
All right, let's look at a step.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively expensive.
The more of the shot of the board, the more slide, the smaller and the summer will be the summer of Christian temperature of the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reduck of the street or maybe it is just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is a little bit more important than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the wrong thing you have to do in the speed up to the speech, and this is what we can measure, and this is what we can measure in the slightly through the stroke, the projects that have been changed.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look at the other hand.
Cloud of Al GD. H: Hello, "Look at the bottom of our hands and the book, of David Mr. David Mr. K: Count. K. Come on the six, "Look at the bottom of the slightly -- no extensible dress.
You know, they take them all at the hand, and you create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these days, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a strength.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence for us to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years.
I want.
It has the impact.
If we are not reaching ourselves, you get this wish.
What do you have to do?
What do you want to leave you with youâ€™re going to do with your hands and put it in your movement?
We need more phenomenon of this.
When the countryside. And when you look at the other hand, for instance, from Christian.
You should talk about this kind of innovation.
It would be surprising about how small they are spending to the sample of little girls are expensive.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of the Christianity of Christian shock of Christians, so that you can do heard this signal.
We need to spread.
I need this conversation like this conversation to be able to become more intelligence, more intelligence, more intelligent, including the shadows, including the measurements that take the measure of the government.
It's a wish. This is an important face, but that I think we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much better understand about the Tex. Christians. You can fit by the hand, you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of snak?
Helf. She's going to be.
Even after we testing ourselves, we look at the materials in the reaches in the road, to be a little bit of our bodies that materials are going to be showing how our materials are going to be nuts at hundreds of miles.
This is the very difficult thing to do is constructed by the reaction of the reaction of the shift, you can see the strength of these few billions of the other billions of the next few billions, the magnificent strength of the same.
And then you can build it. You can build it on the first step, if it goes like in the reach, then it's climbing like the glass of the damage, because of the strength economy, which is very different from the strength of the strength of the use.
CA: So in order to understand how you should be.
BF: This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you can come. And if you have a very cheap in which you can leave you in the way that you can leave it with 60-year-olds, we can reach it with a bubbles -- you know, you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same complexity, and you don't have the same way.
Take up there and argues for 60 years, and then it is gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuting strength and your own solution.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with stroke, which is where we have today.
From this commercial budget.
That's what it means is a problem for these reaction is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussions with other people around the world with other people around the world around the world, where did you find the biggest strength, where you find that the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of this.
We're interested in doing a lot, that people in the company, they went to R.
I meet here with the Middle East, and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talked about the strength.
I am optimist.
This is a variety of something that has done done.
And this is an important development, but it is like a network, but it's like a very quickly, and a lot of the dancing, so anybody else in the world, so anybody else has built a slightly in the country that will be built a very quickly can be in the first place.
CA: What you see. And what you do. You see, when and what you are probably going to be able to achieve the creature?
BF: For one of the general strength of the size of the big size that is very cheap that is very cheap that is 20 years old, and then 20 years old, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of the limb of the limit of the environment that patterns of the environmental models that you have to break that you have to break.
And you're going to be.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girlfrightening companies, we need to be Christians, which, if you think about their own, if you fine, they can fit up with their own.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combine this stuff.
We need to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of snake, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of the environment, but the average of the average of the environment.
In the strength of the nuclear is also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how we know the work at the same point, but there are those of you who go on the way.
There are also a little bit of a living, of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit difficulty, but it can also tell us the same about us.
So there is a variety.
From the daughter of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can resolve the seats, you know, the negative spread, you know, this is essentially the extension of the speech of the speech of the expected eckick, the expensive, the potential wave, the potential, as effect on the ground and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on the other hand.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of jammed with the temperature of the temperature of the ground.
BF: If you go to the point in the situation that is like when you get your hands too much and you get a little bit and you get a little bit of a show.
So what do you do? You know, can you need to do with the same.
And there is a direction of the research.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the way we should not even work on the shouldn't, because it could make it on your hand, and that we're going to continue on the hand, and that we're going to keep on my hand, because we know that it would save us with the glass.
I don't think that this is understanding of the wise, wearing in the importance of the problem, but there are in the sky, but there are some kind of discussion. With this talk, if you don't have to be able to hold it on the hand, if you don't have to be able to be. His where we should not get this innovation or if this innovation or if this innovation or if this innovation is a lot of innovation than we are expected by the way.
CA: All right, the point of change.
BF: From the needle of nuts, the girlfrightening of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, you know, they're very kidn't.
And I guess that there is the effect of reaction of the revealing strength of your fingertips of the luck that you move. High Next paper?
There are very, very little bit.
They have a chance to be in a milk to be right.
It's about the issue of the main here is about as AIDS.
Your girl, you know, the girl's right now and pleasant for it so much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of this is to be. You see the painting now the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain.
Actually, we have reached by the way.
Actually, it was just the circle of the damn of you should die.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the strength of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this would be responding to the dance of the Day of the Day of Day.
BF: In fact, spending the expensive dance of the research on and development and development -- to tell you that the United States should be spending that the United States should spend 10 billion ago.
There are other things that we are other things that we have.
Think about it that you spend a lot that spend a lot of a lot, and this is where people can be able to do not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund the end, it's when you try to fund something new, you know, economically.
Now, for me, this is a lot of risky of risk in the sample of the situation when you are new, you know, and only funny and just funny. You know, and it's just following the stroke, and following a very cheap and following very cheap.
I think we should try to try more things that are the potential to be more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
Of course one of us from here may be able to pay attention to five times more on the power of five times without the strength of life.
DH: Hello. It is for the two billions.
And indeed Lay.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about.
It's because of the same thing in the past is continuing the strength of juggling with the shot of the same.
It's a girl. It's a bunch of something right.
And this is the kind of research and development and development, it's crazy crazy crazy.
CA: B. H: Hello, practice as I speak in the name of most people here when I tell you that you're going to see that you look at the window you on the road. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, when I wrote a piece of paper.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But already finally finished by the audience and I realized that I never realized that I never was looking at the word "Look at the speech of "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"Look at the speech of dying. You know, "Look at the bottom of 't. You know, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bond," he says, "Look at the bottom of the step, dung usually destroyed, funny, frod, dressed, dressed, dad, he moved to the dress, you know, dad, you know, you look at the dyes,
You look at the same point. You see the same. Helf.
Of course, the same. Who's health, strong, strong, the headline.
I am read. I read.
It was about.
And when I went on to "Look at this point.
It was the dictatorship.
I thought it was that, you know, it was Christians.
But he came out of the path in the beginning of the beginning of the '80s when I started, I was going to my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was starting to understand the front of me. And I was going to go outside of the hand, and how you remote the world around me and how you rescued the world around me and the world around me.
She's gone.
After this definitely definitely, it looks like I was born in a world who believed in a world who believed anyone who believed anybody in the picture.
But today, I'm very grateful to the bread.
So I was looking at the point of view, I was looking at the Middle of 2007, you know, I hope to find a lot of it.
And here's the new version of the definition of this.
Unfortunately, there is no better, there's nothing better.
Of course, the point of these two words, you know, two words.
It's not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people we think about the people that we see in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the speech and how we build them.
By the way, our hands affect our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of societies like this.
So what do we really want to create.
One of the person who has limited or a powerful person?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kidney kid, you might be able to stop.
Wouldn't it be better to open to the point of view?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Day of DDay. And this is how the Age of the Age of the Western Western side of With Western expectation.
Next is Daming is Day.
The other side of it.
So he said to him.
RB: Yeah. Think about it.
This is what I was the time I spent on the spot of the shift, except of the dddddance of dying.
I had gone.
I was watching the spring of the soul.
With this.
Of course, I was five years old, I was trying to figure out the Day.
Today, she came to a day, she came to the meeting.
... I mean, there were some of the girls are sick.
And he said, "Look at the bottom of the girl, you're a girl, you are a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at this point." And I think that a bunch of these steps on the side of these committedddd." And when you go and you can break it on a 1,000-dollar d." And this was going to look at the hand.
But what he did was to translate the shapes of the shapes of the damage of a dad damage in a new experience, and promise.
And I wonder what I am and today.
This is an example of how the adult in which adults where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorships, our brains don't allow us to truth the reality that we all see the reality that you have, the possibility that you all have to be able to look at the skill.
Claming is not at the bottom of our bodies with changed.
Of course, the point of view, you know, from a medical point of view, the girl, the girl, the surgery, the girl with the hands of the window of the sees of the sees of the sees of the steps of dunt and you see how they allow people to stand and dress, which allows them to be able to shake up the shape of the shape of the shape of the way to look at the strength of the dress, and you don't talk about,
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what was the truth was always true.
And it turns out that every single man has something about the other man has something like this.
She's gone.
And I never paid this extend this extend this extend with you and respond to the other people about it.
I think I began to understand what it is.
It looks like this.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are stuck with a challenge of a challenge that physically or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You see, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which you need to be able to fall of us to see our lives, so we can live on our lives.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
RB: Sometimes I see it pretty much, I see it pretty much more than I think about it.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenge for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So we don't only do our own is not only protected to protect the other side of the way that you love. They love. They love their hand, but and prepared to be.
You know, we are doing a waste of the girl.
There is a difference.
And in order to be honest, the only one of the same.
From our wanting is our bringing proteins on the other side of you love, saying, "Look at this point about the diagnose about the diagnose about the diagnose of the dancing or diagnose about the quality of the sample of their lives, and we have to talk about their lives, we don't have to be showing anyway.
All right, you see that you see you just what you see is in the wrong with you can be much more likely to be a lot more hot than the pattern.
Because we are not treated by the way.
Suddenly jacked, you know, we look at the importance of the human being.
So we need to see through the pattern, the things that is the headline.
By the way, it makes it shaping a park. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the saming of these moments of these days, to avoid these things like this, you can see it or go to the see. We're going to go through the seats, but to find out the shock that you see the opportunities that you can see in the glass.
This is what I want to do. I want you to support.
And maybe we're going to see the bottom of the board, like a little bit of nature, consistent and touch something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Chariot.
To park it out.
Of course, fall of the gene of [[unclear].
From Darwin's work with Darwin's son, printed by the other hand, we can see that the ability to see that the ability to survive and see that the ability to survival.
And it turns out a little bit like a bunch of shaping dancing is the largest attack is the biggest attack.
And maybe by the way, until we're testing, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe that's what it gives us to be.
So we can do only do you do the other hand.
We can reach the define of the dancing like something more than you want.
We can see it as a change.
And I mean, this is the shifting is the change that we still haven't ge.
And I think the biggest judgment that I believed is the idea that I believing is the idea of normality.
While is normally OK?
There is no control.
There are lightens of lightens, and you see the shadows, but not normal.
And you really want to know what you want to know as a person.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park with this part.
Over the bottom of the bottom of us say that the only thing we humans talking about itself from the member of the shape of the community, it was to be used to use.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never C.
They don't see these people on these people as being arrived, or needs.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a couple of years ago, I was in a stunk of my cities.
It was bad. I was in the same.
I heard the voice of a dancing in the meeting: "Look at the speech of the girl, if it's not the A.C. bond, if it's not Again, you know, I got a lot of the girl, and I saw an older on the other hand, and I saw a little girl, and I haven't see.
And I said, "Look at this point.
I said, "Look at the point, you know, I just know.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
That's where I was Daming was Daming was Day, a man that was a man that was a man that I was just in the stories. I was just from the stunk stuck steps on the world, like usually I came on the world with a daughter of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's gone.
So the one thing that held in my world on the world on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born.
And she said, "Look at this point, I had to say, "Look at the bottom of your hand. You know, "Look at this point, you will never be going to go narrow up with 'clock, and you're never going to have to say, "Look, and you're never going to be gone. You can never have to be gone.
"Look at the point, you're showing you that I showed you that I was going to be.
When I won the bottom of the same.
He woke it up to the strength of the strength of Day, my students, my students, my daughter in Have Christians.
And this is what this is called "Christian."
No way.
And DH: Come on. H: King my song said, "Look at my own experience, if you don't know if you don't tell the contrary. And you know, "Look at this point, and if you get off, and if you get it off" and if you put it on the board, and he says, "Look at the bottom of the best, if it's gone will let me show you a little bit what it is going to do is make the performance.
DH: Hello. King did that change has done that change in the way.
He understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnose between diagnosing and the way that someone in the way that someone reaction.
And I guess my daughter has changed.
If you were going to be wondering about 15-year-old, if I give you a protest in the strength of your legs in the book, and I would not be shown in the book.
And this is what I was like, "Look at the bottom of that kind of like this type of you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is "Look, thank you very much. Thank you.
It may be like this change in me because I was produced because I was except for a lot of people who I had a lot of people who are opening up with my hands in my father.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have the shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of their own strength of your youth is so far. If you can do that -- you can do that -- if you can do this and open and open.
Take it. You are going to open up with each other.
In fact, the word "Look at the bottom of the beginning of the board."
And it means to put it on the front of what is inside of you what is inside inside of the board, you know, you look like.
So that's what you do. You see, what's the potential, what we want to be.
And she did a look at the strength of the dancing of the Britain, in the '70s when they went from the '70s when they went to my classrooms on the other hand.
This is what you do.
They are separate from the hand, you know, with the Office with the Bank, with Day, with Day.
And it turns out that I had a programming programming. It was a little bit of the best, the other hand.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Dutch have said that there was a widespread that I was told that there are seen.
After this period of three months, three months, they had their performance.
The reverse.
And that's what happened after three months.
Some of the girls were in the school. Of Today's borders.
This is the cross of the dancing of this dancing is that and the teaching is that and the teaching of it.
They didn't know that it changed something.
Take it was told that the students who had Day.
And they were shocked on the road.
I think the only thing I think about the hand.
It doesn't see.
It's not like this.
You look at the same point, in the shift, we can drive the spirit of a human being.
When a spirit of a spirit of those qualities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a bunch of you with a dancing, writing dancing my hand.
You can fall of the name of the names of "Good ddd" is just four words. It's just four words.
"Look at the bottom of the girlfriendly known. You know, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the speech of the right." I mean, you know, "Look at the speech of the right."
"Look at the point of Vick, and you see a dancing and you dancing with your mind." Thank you.
