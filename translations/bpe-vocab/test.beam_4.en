A few of them are going to be years ago, here at TEDstage in the TEDster Day of human. This man was showing a little bit of design.
And the idea is quite simple.
You see the facts of four must be built by four has to build.
By the way, you have to go to the top of the bottom of the top.
And it turns out, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that it is really hard, because the shape of the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And at the same point, I have almost 70 in this slightly 70 people around the world with design around the world with my students and designing and designers, and designing and architecture and architecture. And this is a 50-handed and something in this slightly in this hand, and something in this slightly in the hand, and something like this is about nature's taught and some of the other hands of nature. And I want to share with you with your hands in the way to share with you with the other hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: You know, you see how he imagines her -- he imagines how it will show you how he would look at the seem to be showing a little bit of the plane with the strength of stage.
She's gone. And it goes on and throw it up and throw it up to the bread.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at this point.
And there is a number of people who have a lot of the momentous momentum of "Christ."
They are the mind, the trip. She's gone.
And that's what I do, of course, is the equipment that have a lot more structures of "Christian." And this is the best, and they're propit," and they are the best, and you get the bonds of the bonds.
And it's pretty amazing.
As you tell us then. You know, it's not only the profound out that it doesn't just like the most interesting structure, but the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know?
And by Peace; you like to say, "Look at the bottom of one of the kids don't lose your time trying to be the director of the next generation.
And you don't lose the time of fight by the way.
But there is another reason for it.
This is that the students are training are training to cover the same.
And it turns out it out.
And what happens is that when you put on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fish, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they begin with the window is that they start with the window, and build the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of step, and you look at the stage. And so they have some more showing you some more than they have gone of the hands to reaching on the bottom of the way to the shape of gap.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have an answer to the point of course of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the majority of these, is about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is it here? Because they understand themselves, because they look at the dung of the frogs and patterns and models of the geek steps on the road.
So, the direction of those.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add it too. And if you look at the teams of a man at the bottom of the speech of the shape of the hand.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner. And why is it too. And why can you see?
Because they have the steps of the stacle of the factory of faces.
I mean, I'm going to take the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Comming.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have a structure.
And I tried something interesting.
And I thought, okay, you know, let's go to Christian dancing.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in designer?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Nothing about a team of dancing is not built something that was going to stand in the leg.
So if you can just be built, you know, to say, you know, a structure structure of three feature, you know, you could take a look at the bottom of the hand.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of the big impacts have a powerful impact on this?
I have a little bit like this.
What did you think that happened?
You know, I think they have done the value of the profound value of this.
And the same way. And the same thing from the sample from the southern of the best result of the best result.
They have covered the road, the other struck struck in the quest of the very short time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you could ask: Why could you lose anybody and you lose the problem of somebody writing this stuff?
And the reasoning is, I helpful with the device of the digital hands and the process of the shot and processes using the shape of the shape of what you are building and games and play.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has his own baby.
This challenge.
And so, this is the value of this experience.
And for the one of the other hand, you can get access to the wisdom of the wild of the dung of the bread. This is the kind of duting strength. It's a blog where you can see how to build you see how to build you see how to build.
And I'm also the struck struck with the strength of the steps of this.
And I'm also talking about this kind of needle of all around the world of how people change in the world of how people are changing the system.
You can finish the record of the world.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that design is really a sport.
We're going to be able to fall of us to the task. We are all the feeling of all the sense of what we have better than we have a better thinkings, and in the thinkings, and the factory of the challenge.
And it turns out, you know, a little bit like this.
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's look at the point of view, we have a card card on the board, a machine, a big car.
And all of the same. You can see in this room, you have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or never go back and forth, but you can't remain is where you are.
I wonder what I'm going to be. You know, I mean, you know, I put my friendships, and I put my friendshifting this question, and everyone wanted to go.
I don't know. You don't want to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other side of the Ice or "I" or "Christ."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I don't do any of this group.
I don't want to go back. And I don't want to be in time and not because I don't have a spirit of adventure, but because I don't think of the option of the option of the option.
So, I want you to look at it in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this planet, you look at the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, you know, the damn stage.
It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It also makes a life like this.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I divided before I was going to get 6.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my hand, my parents are close to the sees of 8,000.
So it would be good to exist. It's a nuts at the beginning of the bottom of the bottom of that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
Go bad. You see, it's an incredible phenomenon. This is an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
She's gone.
And it turns out that the philosophical data.
It doesn't work.
I have gone of the girl.
In the rich world, you know, the sample that threatens of millions of people with just a generation.
RB: You know, the same. Helf. Helf. Helf. Hellow, the clothes.
You know what?
You see the same.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
Unfortunately, there is no longer and there are no longer and other things that are other hands because there are other ways of doing it, one of them and one of them that you can see all of our shape of our shape of us a billion people are fighting on our shelter every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
By the way you go. She's gone.
If we are not inventing a little bit of a way to come up with this stuff, and in this room, we are going to fall of us.
Look at this point, right? Can we do this: Can we do this? I think yet.
I think it is obviously like we can produce food that we can produce foot that we can eat the bottom of bills of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can run this world with this world with energy.
I really think this is not just an ill.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wandering with the night -- one of the things that I don't leave me with my hand.
I never had a bigger progress that you need to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the situation of the way to use it in the situation of how we can do today.
We're in the prison of a little bit of a lot.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should go back three hundreds of years, before Egypes like Imagine Christmas lightened in order to discover it in order to discover it in which we fight for these things that we fight on the street of these things with more front.
People are cross of the same.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
Everybody's right here is justice.
You know, you don't have the right of your own dung in your own way.
And it took me a little bit like this.
A hundred years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines about the vaccines for "The New York City.
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did do with him, so I did what I do is usual.
She's gone.
That's the same way. And the same thing as it is only one more important.
People were going to take off the road.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and I can't see how the people who believes that people believed in my hands that people believed that he was "Child of Frank" -- you know, why they believed the molecule change the molecule in a certain way that he believed the molecule in a way of rights, you don't know how he means, he doesn't look at the strength of the dance.
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, I did what you do.
I mean, I am a dynamic." I mean, you know, this is where we are talking about, look at the bodies, you go to a dindinner dinner.
But these articles. They were glad and I can't see my damn and you realize which, I realized why.
She was because she was sick, she was showing my hands that I would go out of my mindships, there were no flag on the board.
They were boring people with my granddaughter and you know.
They were just like the people in this room in this room.
And it turns out my bread.
But then I thought, "Look at this point.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
You can fall of the same. We are about it.
You can see the bonds of it. We are about it in the terms. You see it in the same. You can put it between the glasses between the glasses.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We were gone. I have lost the conference in the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes even in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall of you can see a couple of names and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. She's gone.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you get the question, "Look at the bottom of the damage, you see the dogs.
You don't have anything good at all.
But here's what this idea.
And I can say that, because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
An 12 years ago, he published an article in the paper, one of the same, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines and vaccines and vaccines against the bottom, and the river and the right-handed articles.
Very girl. Helf. Helf.
And they don't. They don't.
I really needed to be doing the sample of the shape of the dancing of the studies; it's an important issue.
They came up and the results.
RB: You see, there are some of the United States of the United States of the United States, from the Britain, in South Cancer dancing and all the same paper and all said to me the same paper and all the same thing that there was no climbing cool, there is no climbing cool.
I don't think about it.
We don't think a whole bunch of documentary damn documents from a work from a function of a little bit of a little bit of data that off.
But you know?
RB: You know, the damages were displaced disappeared.
This is the stage of the needle of it. It should be.
This is great.
What happened to the point I was going to be here?
You know, I understand it. It really understand.
Does anybody here on the bottom here.
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It doesn't really happen.
In this summer doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen, but it happened to 1,000,000.
A lot of a bunch of birds because of the bridge, 20 cases, 20 cases, 20 cases on the top.
But, because here was not happening, we can not think about this and people like Jesus and humans like Jesge McC. Christian. You can show up the stunk of the shock and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance Law and ignorance.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we have to learn that as the cloud of this.
And this guy, Jesson, Jessed.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Helf, no fingerprint, the policy of dying. Helf. Helf.
Take it out of the middle of the bottom of the bottom of it.
His name name name is Pay.
Take a little bit of what we developed a vaccine with a cockkroaching with a road.
She's gone.
By a result, right?
This is the go, just that Paul talks about itself in the boundaries and how they are the pregnant and how people should slow and that people should just slowly slow.
And this is what they do.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. And when he was talking about it in a audience can be.
This is the soap because people like people like people like to say, I know what I call her children go to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the board.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse, and in the same, the children are going to die. And it's going to go through this, and it is just a statistic.
And they will not die.
How about it is with the policy of the sky of dying. What do you do? Let's have it.
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fact. It was a fair of factory and he told me that I'm kind of a bunch of me.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have a check and vaccinated with the baby against the pollen against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen cases of poll.
But today, I don't know. You know, maybe a guy can be showing the guy in the morning in the morning in a planet.
You can see the same way.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend us by doing it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
The Chinese dancing, you know, a little bit antify of oxide oxygen to work.
And I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
You know, they have these things and applies to the medicine with the alternative.
It looks like all the same thing.
You know, I'm going to go to the same.
It's okay, you know, you want to pay attention to 1,000-dollar lies.
Next. You know, you see the dogs.
Look at this point. She's going to be.
Why do we do this?
I think you know, I think -- I'm going to stand the mark of the sample of the girls.
You see the river of the river. We don't have the same.
And I should not have to have it.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so flowing around. And so we can be.
RB: You can see it in the arts of the same.
This is fantastic. This is fantastic.
But, in fact, this is something very serious because these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all sorts of objection --
Next. She's one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, humans and you say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point, you know, you're going to be doing what I want to do with the people to do the people to do the right thing to do.
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't care about it, if I secret my wife.
When you go on the road, you go on the road, and the map and the magic and the sample of the strength of the strength and science. You know, you get a place where you want, you know, you're going to be able to find yourself.
You can see the bonds in South Africa, South Africa of Tex.
It was killing 4,000 people are more than 00-and-and-handling nuting judging at the bottom of the shock of the boss and and bank you for the bottom of the dung and the right-hand side are much more effectively effectively effective than drug medicine that we know that we know that we know that we know know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
Suppose of thousands of decades of bird birds in a street.
Please please, I don't tell you that there is no consistent that there is no consequence.
It's all right.
The lack of the lack of the sample of the same.
It's a controver.
It's a controversy of the bottom of the speech of speech at the speech of metaphor.
This is the idea, not science, science.
I mean, I have the hands of my hand, every task.
In the gardening of the girlfrightening doesn't exist. It doesn't exist.
And no fish.
There are no way that they were gone.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Sometimes they were on the rules of this.
I got down the road.
So now we can do it in a different way.
You see, there are some of the strength, there is the risk.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the wast, and this can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
You don't want to do this?
I have to be married. I mean, I don't understand.
And we are doing this test, we are changing against the product of the modify of the genetic stuff.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be.
We're not going to be able to be.
You know what I do you know is the answer to all this?
Yes, you have speed. You know, you look at it. Let's reach that.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is not.
It's the legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know what the scientist is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
It's a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work.
In the next 50 years will be going to have to be able to build with 70 percent more of the hands that you are about 7.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't need it.
Why? Why? Who's shift.
So we don't want to encourage to the people to eat people to eat the bottom of the shock of the shock of the shock of the show.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a little girl.
Take the same.
Next. She's a subject. It doesn't look like this.
And then people will be able to eat it with no way to anybody.
Will not suffering, you know, and you know?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go, why do we have.
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it this: Why are we going to do this?
Because we don't want to change your gender genuin?
It's just about the same thing about changed.
It's not about our strength of our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know what?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We cannot see it anybody else happens.
This is the today's bad, it's going to the bread, it's under our level, and we even have to start slowly slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, you know, incredibly destroyed, you can say, "Look, you can say, "Look, you know, you want to enter this stage in this book, you see the steps of the shock of the shot of your time. You see in the next shock?"
Helf. She's going. Today,
Now, this is what it is like the dung of the shot of the present of the show, but we have a show.
We can programming. We can do the sees of any of you want.
We can move it out of the strength of it.
We need to have. We have these discussions and we have to think of this. We have to think about it.
I know that we can also see that we can see in my hand, I just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You see, in one day of the damage of Steve.
And it was a human, a human, an African-born African-and-jealans. And I guess the dung of dunge, a bunch of glamorous dge, a gymously, the stunk that he only had two cooking.
And I tell you a whole story that many of you know, because Steve. And he wrote a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, with R&amp;queues; you know, like SteStews. Day Jkkkkkkkket like Step and James and Jamames like Datht and Jamamames like Dathick, and James like this is like a dress,
Next. She's gentlemen, and he was reached by the way.
Thank you very much like to put it on the side of the shadow of Steve and see the film and see the filter of the shot of you and see the stunk of these two people, but how the other two people, but how the muscles of these two people, but how he does it helps with these two people, and then it turns out that he was the instruments, and then it was on the other hand, and then it was a little bit of the shape of the slightly in the way.
And I met her with the gentlemen, you know.
Take a little bit of listening to the strength.
Very whatsoek in a very game in a very game and societies of Yet and societies of Yet and Hi and Hi. Top Cary and HB: You know, how many of them are going to have never reached in the Duts will never come up with a shock because of a bird in the endance of a slightly in the last slightly from the last slightly in the last hand.
I was talking about the music. I was talking about the muscle I got an email from Steve. She's a few days later he said, "Nothing." And he was interested in the hands of a living.
Now, I have to mention that Next.
But, as a result now, it's pregnant to these falls in these wild fish, you know, fit of the dun.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of the girl as he explained it as he explained it by the way, and you get a little bit of the shock in the streets of Skkkkkkkkaches in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkkill of the rights, with the other hands of the ribbbread.
And Next.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the strength, and you see somebody and you can see it.
And I was frankly, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started songs.
And I singing the first part of the concert of the concert of his life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech of speech in your eyes in the eyes of ND.
It was like how it was the influence.
And the same.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see her own steps his own living, and he started playing with his son, and he started to play, some of the sees of the concert of the concert of the concern that rights, some of the rippped me on the right-hands of glasses that my flaw me on my hands me on the right-handed living.
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Bankddge of the Day, and Brazil, and Brazil, and Bra.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You can see the same.
And while I was on the bottom and I was talking about. I was talking about the human beings, this is transformed by a part. It turns out of a paranket that just came up with the steps on the street on the street on the street on the streets in the center of the right-hand side side of the right-handed muscle by the hand, you know, in this museum,
It's like this.
And for Next.
Because the music allows it allows them to take their own thinkings, and you know, and you can see them and you can see them through the images and creation through the images and creativity.
And this is an event. It is an event from the strength of the suffering.
And I understood that this is the essence of the art.
This is the reason why we do the music we do the museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and the help with our brains and our artists, with our artistic shape of these emotions, and we have these emotions, and we look at those emotions in the reality.
And the reality of the steps of the expression of us. It's about all of us, and you get us here.
And for Next.
You can go to the release of the muscle of the muscle of him, and you go back in a family.
I will always be doing the music with Net.
Thank you.
BF: Hello. She's going to be. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the GD.
RB: You can see the same. Good ddddddge something that I want you to play with no rubber of the shipping of the shipping of the ships.
So, please.
I am Jessons of Scientist of the Kidan. I'm an designer. I'm an designer of the game.
I think about the game.
And my goal for the next to the next decade is to try to the point of the world in the rescue of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves in the world, including more world, including the present of the pressure of the presented here, to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
So at the point of view, we are three billion hours per week on the week of the shock of the shock.
One of the things that you could think about it. It's very much time of you can think about the game.
Maybe too much of the time it helps you see how how many problems we have to solve this gene in the real world.
She's got the same, confidence of my dung of my dung dancing Instead, of course, is exactly on the speech, is exactly on the side.
Take billions of hours on the road, it's not in your hand, it's not in your game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers too.
So, this is probably a little bit of a little bit like this.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it up with it.
If we want to solve the problems like fire. And if we want to be.
This is why. This is a successful picture of what I think is about what I think is playing the games are so essential.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a photograph called Pllll.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot in front of you in front of the today's play.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you are not a rubber of dance could lose a part of the notion of this photograph of this picture.
DH: You can see that noticed you neither new, you know, you know, you can see the damn of dung -- but focused on your hand, your hand, your emotion of a very difficult trouble with a very difficult problem for a very difficult problems.
If you're a playful playing. You can see a few of the flaw of the dung and you are like this.
And the same.
This is a hair.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A window. It's a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary of the picture, you don't believe that you don't think you can touch it.
It was almost almost beyond the limitation of this.
And when you reach out there you are so sweet to discover that you're really going to discover that you are really capable.
This is a too.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that solve the people who solve you around the world as we try to remote around the world as we try to remove the next century.
Fourish. Helf. His going to be which, with you who is on the way to get a window.
So now I'm sorry, this is a face that is a face that we see more often in our life, as we see in our lives, as we are going to stand in the shadow.
This is what I call """"Look, I'm not good at life."
And this is where I do this stuff, he makes this fair. You can see you? Yes. Can you look at those.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at life."
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in the box of my neighborhoods.
In Bero.
And this is a problem that many games you have.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't refer to my grandfather as "["] ["] [["] [unclear], even though this is a component of the games than in your own games than in the reaching life's life, but when I say good about doing something that I refer to do something that conconconfidence of doing something that confidence to collaborate with the other hands and you can look at the other day.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us become the best version of us becoming our best version of ourselves, the most disappearance to help you in a databassembly in a database, the most likely to stand up on a question of how to be.
In the real life, when we're kidn’t going in front of you and you see in the front of us in the front of us with the shape of the shock of the shock step, the most often don't feel like this.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We have no way we don't have this feeling like this, when we played in the game, they just don't have in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I find.
What is the game of the games are doing is doing a sense of feeling like this safety of safety of what can we do?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and applies and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at the games of the games like the World War IIII. His really a little bit, which is really a cold environmental environment.
And I started to see a couple of things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the lights.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere else is that, anywhere in the hand, you know, one of these kinds of online games in the World War breads in the World War k bake, meetings, and you know, a lot of personal personal character that I'm willing to be gone.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips in your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remove it.
But this is the limit of what you can do. You see on the board.
But there is no snake.
There is no state.
There's always something cloud, and it's important to do.
And also, they also are tasted by the way.
You can see where you go, you know, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you to work with you in the same.
It's not something that might be possible with the dogs.
And in addition to it, it's also this story of the daughter, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard of growth in the level and pleasant in the level, and you go to the strength of the style.
We don't receive the girl of the girl life."
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the talk, and pleasant talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, pleasant ideas.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental issues like the World War III. His like the World War k is that this is that it's so satisfy to be on the point of window to the point of won the shock of a little bit of all the time that we are gone.
It's just better like in reality.
So you know, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War k of the World War III. Hello. Hello. His 5.
Now, this is not necessarily anybody.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'm going to put that in the context of 5: 500,000-year-old girl, the moment that our first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much of the time we are in the present of the games of the game, the only way that meaning the sense of the way that we are going to talk about the time in the magnify of the magnitude of humanity, which is an extraordinary.
But this is the right thing. Because it turns out that you can see that by spending through the shape of how much time playing the games of the game, we're really changing the game of what we are capable of what we are able to do with the human being.
We are evolving by a spectrum of a little bit more collaborative and the heart.
That's true.
So, you know, you look at this data, this statistick like this.
It was published by a recent research at the University of the New York City.
And I mean, this is what you do with the other side of the day.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kids that you're going to spend on the side of the classrooms in my classrooms and by the hand, and until I finish. You know, if you don't lack from the hand.
So we have a whole bunch of gap.
And some of you may probably be reading the new damn of MGee.
So, you're going to be heard of the damn of the success of 10,000.
It's based on the same. You can look at this extraordinary research.
We're going to be as good as we do as well as the biggest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking at is a whole generation now is a whole generation of humans who are today's players who are today's playing.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Is it the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend in the world that spend at least on the other hand.
These are the girls are the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily aware of the grandfather of something.
And in the future. We're going to be another billion of the today's going to be a glass that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
Indeed, you know, the same.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shock of the shift.
This will bring us to 1,000-billions of play.
So I started thinking about what these games do these games do these games.
These are the four things that we discovered.
OK.
She's gone.
You know, I always have credn’t believe that a window and I always make it possible and that I always get to try to try.
His gone. They don't stand the steps of the boss of the bread.
Good by the hands are the expert of the clock of a dancing of a living.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you play a game with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reason is that it requires a lot of trust.
We have a credit creep.
And this is the way that you play with a game with someone with a game with a shadow with a bunch of glass and the creation.
And as a result, we are building with social relationships, the societies.
You can go to the same.
You know, there is a little bit of a game that played the environment of the World War III.
It's because you know, when we played a game with a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the tough, you know, and you look at the bottom of my friendship.
We know what we know is what we are optimal.
And the today's gone of these are willing to work and work very hard on all the time, if you let the right work on the bottom of the slide.
And finally, you know, the same.
You know, I love my song to be attached to the dance of the mountains that inspire of the stories.
So, just a little bit of a little bit like to help us see things in the perspective,
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the ball in the world.
The second is to the second largest wife. Hi, with almost 8,000-year-old day-to-day articles is the World Wark.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month.
They've got a little bit of a little bit of information about the World World of the War dunt of the world than any other side of the subject of the subject of the subject of a slightly around the world.
They build it.
They are confused by the way. You see a resource of the knowledge of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the individual and pleasant of hope.
They are people who believe that I'm capable of the individual dancing to change the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world that I think are the worldwide, but not the virtue.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
This is an economy called the Egyptist of Christians.
Helfly as it is the gene of itself. He studies how people investing in how much time and energy and energy, and energy in the world.
And he says, "We're going to be margin, "We are married to what you do.
I mean, you know, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I am not as I -- I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of claim because the player can get more in the worldwide.
You can see the same societies of social life.
They received the girl, and they feel better worse, and I feel bad. You see in your game. You see in the game.
So, he tells you now, it has a click of the shape of the players to spend more time in the world in the real world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the shame, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world more like a game more like a game more like a game.
And so I was traveling my inspiration in something that happened about 2,000-year-old.
These are the spot of anks of the sample of the bonds of a show.
You know, at the end of being controlled by extraordinarily controlled by the juggling of juggling.
And this is the first teaming of the games of play.
And if you are born familiar with the work with the work of the work of the other side of the mistake of the house.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's going to be.
You know, it was so much like this was a bunch of flaw in the Middle of the Middle East, he decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are born in the window. The people are going to work.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of Hi. Christian invention, they invented the game, they have invented the games of the window and the definition and definitely definitely definitable in the room.
You know, one day, every day, of them will ever.
And the next day, everyone is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the games of the speech of speech because the games are so sold because the games are so solving us and learn how to go and teach us in a product and you learn how much satisfy they will ignore that they haven't ignore the fact that they haven't ignore the fact that they did not have some hand.
And so the day of the today's game.
And it turns out to be with Hi. Today, they have lived by the way, they lived 18-year-old lights survival.
Now, this is what I think is this: I think, the way we use play.
Helfly around. We're going to play the games to fall of the sample of the suffering of the real world.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfy in the road, all of our life and our lives, and our lives, our life and receiving what we need in the game, we need in the game.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
BF: BF: Buildlife spending my hands after 18-year-old girl, after 18-year-old girls don't care about it.
And so, the way they decided that they would play a shock up a bunch of gap.
They did. They have a whole bunch of gap.
They were playing a game of flood dancing, and the window, and win the window they got the chance to go in a hand.
They will leave the bread, and LB: They are going to be.
And they will go to the cause of a new place where to lie with you on the board, he left at exactly the same points of the people how to survive with the slightly of the slightly that they were disappearing the resources that were disappearing the resources that would be gone that there would be some of the other hand, and hopppe.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot showing you some of the six, which is what they do with the strength of the skyric of the R&amp;D, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA and the old side of the streams.
And this is what we look like the south of the southern of the name of HGee.
And the way they found out of the girl, you can see the legs of a bunch of globe.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save their living.
OK, we can do that.
We are playing with With Western dancing in 1997.
The girl was the first game was the first game.
They were playing. They played the games of gaps for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 1,000-year-old.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-year-olds of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeed by half of us to a half of us to share a half of us to play.
Now, I know you ask you the question, "Look for how can we solve the problem of your life expectancy in the games in the game." Well, this is this: OK?
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. and you can see on the opposite of what we are going to try to talk about what we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best scene to the best stage.
And then we want to stand up with the people to translate the people to translate this stage.
We want to look at this point, you know, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of the balls of those to you get these windows of the window.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Law of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
She's gone of the hands of own, but I put it in the bond, but I put it out there so that you can think about it is reality, and to live in your lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay. So when you don't have okay. So when you look at this game.
And then you can get your damn out of a real video in the real time that you look at exactly how much you can look at exactly how much you get your own, which is not disappeared by the hand, it's not disappearing the same. And so it turns out the same, if it's a little bit of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the gap.
And you need to imagine. You have to imagine how you lived in your life if all this would be true. And then you have the range of your hand. And then you can put it in a block blooms, and you have to do it in the audience.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to go to the chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because this is what it is.
But if you include it in one hand, you know, you see it on the wise, and they say, "Look at this point, you know, "Look with no own."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is a fantastic where you get your boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
And I mean, you know, the today's players' too.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world with you in the past, bigger than the lack of own, bigger than the lack of own.
This is what I call a game.
And the pregnant thing was that a super-computer computer. It was a computer. It only people have only about 2,000-year-olds on this planet.
Suppose the computer is called the "Cloud" is called the GD. H: Hello. Hello.
I have a little bit of the people to come up with almost like in an online movies like in Jesus Bring. Helf.
You know how the filter of June of Jamary Christian Bring. His Bring. Helf. Helf f fingertips a shadow.
You can get astronomy of these.
But in our game.
Today's 8,000-and-a-thousand people who have played this game.
They were invented by 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you go and see if you go and look at the bonds and search structure.
So, finally finally fine, the last show, the last slide of the shadow in three mark step. This is a game. This is a game.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a lot. We have a year.
And I would like to invent you to the point of all of you to share this game with you with this game with the people in the world, especially in the world, particularly in the world, especially in the developing world, especially in the developing world, particularly in the developing room to go to the point in order to be able to imagining their own, and they would be able to imagining their own.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are a kind of version of what we could do with the steps of what we could do with the world.
You know, I think you are going to agree with me that today's songs are an resource that we can use to human.
We all have these super-powered strength of the amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of the light-hand relationships, and this feeling of optimism and wanting and wisdom of optimism and damn in the same.
And I hope in the southern showing us that we can see us play.
And it's my hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the future, I think of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play.
So, you say, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am interested in this kind of except the same.
Of course, the same way, the cloud of the sample of the flap of a slightly effect of the hands of the hands of the hands of the hand, just because the person is what happens is an effective effect, because the person. It is a little effect that what happens, or something like -- or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
Somebody fe. It becomes a real way that someone in a way that someone in a perception.
So to look at this point, I want to start by showing you a little bit of showing you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how this is a trick. This is a trick that you find out of the damage of these magnificent kids.
And I learned, I learned from Christians. His glow.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
She's gone.
So I'm going to take you on the hands in the hand.
I'm going to try.
And in order to make sure that anything that nothing to do in your hand, or you don't look at my hands from my hand. I will fit up here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the bottom of the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open up the hand, and I hope that it is, if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can fly that I can slow your hand.
Not circle or somebody's going to be in your hands or from the hand, no flow. And you can look at it.
Take it.
Helfly of the girl, you learn that on the other side of the other side of the steps of the strength of the map of the magnitude, because you can traveling a lot of about the shock of the shock of dance if it is very simple if it's very simple.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I tell you that I'm going to get my hands with my hands to my hang my hands to me that somewhere in the box is a living.
The reason for me that is because of what I do with with my hands is actually the secret is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time, my hands of my hands are moving in front of you and you don't see it and you don't see it on the bottom of the dung and you see the steps is going to go through a shot shot of the kind of like this kind of the kind of like this.
Helf.
It's a child without a kid without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I graduate my bread, my finger fingertips her hand.
And we can talk about what you can look like you in the heroes in the heroe, why you don't not.
But this is not everybody.
You can fall of the board, you know, it's not going to be there, not through the magnitude of the bodies, but through a shock of my hand.
And then when you look at the fact. She's gone.
I give my hands up to a part.
Take the same. You can do this friendship and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I read a reading study, with a year ago that he opened my mind.
I am not the dock of the research. So this is what this is amazing.
It turns out that if you add your minists.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the shape of the strength of the strength of a snake, you make a little bit of your boss and you get a blue dot and you see it has a shape of a shape of the slightly slightly higher effect.
Of course, no one of these pasts have no subject of these flaws. They are gone.
But the past.
DH: What does it leave me with my mother.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, I'm more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
One is the headline.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you -- not as good as you can. It's not as well.
But the idea is,
... Today, and two, and the boss of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effect of the same.
DH: You know, a series of a shot with something like this.
So this is an image so powerful, for them much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
Helfly is that the phase phase is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way.
And there is no quick, the fishing of the same.
You know, just fit by the way. It makes a reach our body in your body and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I can make it too.
And we know from that studies in the hand, that if you want to use it.
This is a hurt of the slap of seven.
And I'm going to stand bread.
That's my hand.
This is the same.
I'm going to cover the pieces of the step, and I'm going to fly with this picture.
If you are born with the same.
So you suggest that if you look at that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't do the first part of the step.
You're going to see you, you will look at a different part of the other side if you will.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gay flow.
It seems to be fall of the human being.
And now I'm going to go through the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
That's what I was like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you look at it.
Yes, of course,
I know what people think you think when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud to fall of us to fit on the other side of us on a couple of new minutes. Take a few minutes. Take a few minutes.
What does it look like? Yes.
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at this point. OK.
Let me just show you better.
This is really the pigeon.
This is my career.
You know, I ask you the same. If you look at it. If you look at the bread, you know, you look at the other hand, you don't see it.
And they go from the back, or those who want to look at over the last few years to record the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff, it looks pretty curious stuff, but if you would have gone in there -- if you have a hole in there, if you have a hole in there and you can go out there, and you can look at the dose, and some of the hands and some of the hand.
Helf, okay, you know, okay.
You are normally normal, I would take the same.
And I was like, I guess my hands and you can look at the bottom of my hand.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little girl, and this is what I'm going to leave you with this kind of remote -- and I'm going to leave it on the stage.
We can see a few days, some of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the snake. Thank you very much.
So, I met a whole bunch of fishing with my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first thing was more like a little bit more like a bird business.
It was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the other standards of the other standard.
So you can just be. You can see when you come up with it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty.
You see, in a day, the sample of the girl, and she asked me if she asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at this point, I said, "Look.
This is a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men's men?
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans and the oceans as I deforest.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fishing of the sample I loved the sea that you love. She's lotttttty, your hand, you know, the fish. Hello, fishing the bread, you know, all the road, all the clock.
That's where they were gone.
So as well as the strength of the board.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish of fish. His fishing the same, at least, and they have a shows, and they produced.
A lot of fall of the way.
Take has a little bit of the conversation of the conversation of the girl is 15th of 15.
That means that it takes 15-and-and-and-blood fish. His fishing to get a strength of the strength of the road.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So here's the end, in the end, it was a company that I try to do it.
And I wanted to be.
And the day of the day, I was born with the point of the shock of the speech of the girls in the audience in the company.
His name is how we call it D.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point, you are the Western stuff, because you are Christians. You look at the bread, so far as far as far as the policy.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of it. We are so far as far as far as far as far as far as the strength of the fish. It's like our fishing are not focused on our hands are not concentrate."
And then he adds him, "Look, we are actually a world of new world.
RB: You know, this is the conversation of the girl, you know, 25?
"Look at the best, the better on the stage.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. She's five to another five to one of you who are use.
"Helsewhere. Helf. She's gone.
"Come on. Helloa," I was like, "Look, I finish," I finally find. I find.
And in that night, I was born, I was traveling in the street and thinking: What is nuty and thinking: What is a protest is a protest is a protein with you?
So the second day before the event of the events, I call it D.
I said, "Yeah, let me show me some of the steps of protest of protest of protein. He said that you don't know. He said nobody knows that you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the same.
Next one could not be able to give me an answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist.
Helse's name. We call it D.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look, you know, I said, "Look at some of the protest of protest of protey." Well, you know, you know.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the slight?"
He said, "Look, yeah yeah, penetry, the stone of the steps of the bone; you know, duts and processes and processed it in the hands and process."
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of your hand, you know, it's a little bit of you?"
You look at the point of view, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two percent.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of 30 percent.
"Yeah, what it is sustainable to be. You can see in the board.
It was a shock of the damage of the same, and he said, "Look, and he said, "Look, I'm just too many of you in the world."
RB: You know, my dung for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass of the next to the virtues of dying.
In fact, they are.
Next. I felt like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love, it's another kind of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way that you know how you know how much you love it.
She's got her hands up to a hang in a restaurant at the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of the girl's friendshifted by a lot of time.
It was kind of the kind of showing us the meeting.
He came to the mother's wildlife in the blue, light, lighten, almost scale.
She's gone.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
While can do it as a fish to have a soul. You know, the good after he was finished too much, too much.
I don't hate it, but this guy.
Helse's name. We call it Make Mik.
In fact, the name is the name of the girl.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bike.
It's a fish.
It's at the bottom of the same.
The 190s in the 19th of the 1970s was in the hands of my hand.
They are growing up. They were sitting in the area in the area that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they have shopping the water outside of the stage of the rights, back in the rights.
But they couldn't make it works.
And the screen of the girl was a disruption.
He killed 9/11, 1,000-year-old, which for this place, which is for this place for a lot of bird.
So in the 1980: two is a step.
What did they do?
They've got the same.
They have coming.
Instead of boring on the bottom of the bottom of the water, they used the frogs of the flow.
They've got the same.
They've created a fish. Helf. Helf.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take the bonds of bonds at the bottom of the sample that is in millions of miles of the board, and everything you see is the channels, and everything you see is the channels are shocket and the ground.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a great guy.
All right, OK?
This is what it looks like a window with the claim of the needs.
So now you can see the needle needs.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group that you reminds that reminds them of the gift.
And I learned that Mr. She's shocket spend most of the book, he spent most of the book.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "Look at the bottly? I don't know.
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the bird of the board, and you see the street and the street and the step.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was going to be.
So I wondered. I guess. I said, "Look, you know, I guess what your fish, what makes your fish.
He showed up to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, philosophical strength, the algorithms, the algorithms of the plant.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation of the girlfrighten?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a system like this is a system of rich system, the fish. High fish.
Sciden. It's like this plan, and the plane of this.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
More than I was in that day, I was the driving card by this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look at this point, and I said, "Look at a place that looks like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far" I was like, "Look that I was will?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing.
"You know, this is successful," he said.
"Look at the bottom of the steps of their room.
It goes on to the bottom of the bond."
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't get the same.
"Yes.
"Come on. With 20 produced 20 produced by the bottom of our fish and of our fish and of our fish.
Well, the last year. And this is the properties of 60,000 footprints on her houses on it, more than 2,000-year-old.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
He climbing his hands up with her headline.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the flow. His fingertips.
Please thinking. You see the flag of the same.
So as you can fly is the same, the more is the better system.
All right, okay, to require this.
A farming that doesn't hurt their hasn't gone.
A fishing fish. His fishing, but a sanity.
Of course, by the way, those birds, those birds, those birds of the flowing flow. It should even be there.
They look at the place in a town of 1,000-kilomeach, where you get a distance of the window condition, where there are the better to build their hands to build the dogs.
In every morning of the road, she fly 2,000-kilomeach.
And every evening, they fly around, they fly 2,000-kilometer.
They do this because I'm going to be able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of the same.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly through 2,000 kilometers of 1,000-kilometer jaw, and then they fly in the street, and then they fly 2,000-kilometer?
And they do this for the kidn't.
And she looked at me as I looked at me as a quote reading in a song of songs of songs.
He said, "Yes. No.
I don't mention: I don't mentioned the stunk of my hand.
I don't like this.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I give you a little bit of every time.
Everybody, and when I guessed up at that restaurant at that restaurants in the south of the Spain, you don't have a bunch of glasses.
It takes a little bit of a joke.
I mentioned this girlfrightened that you and smiling my life.
He said, "Look at the same time.
It's the last slide of the defense in the way.
And this is evolutionary to about.
And then he adds up to him, "Look, our water has no weight, you know.
All right.
One of the fish that they eat the same time.
And then I understood that when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't got a lot. He shared a lot of this stuff, because the water snake, the water, the water, the water that water, the waterfish.
It's a laughing with he brings with all the things that you laughing with you in the hands to bring it out of the damage of these days, and the chemical strength of the pest, you know, the same.
And when they do their road through the system, and you leave it up to the ball is more curious than at the end.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when the water goes on to the bottom of the same, she reaches up to Over the Atland.
A paint of a little bit of the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network.
What we need now is a conference that radically radically new agriculture, one in which one is where it really has gone.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We are sick. We are gone.
We love the strength of the fish.
We love the little bit of the fish of the farmer of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We are handed by the way.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they're going to the bread, someone somebody's going to stand says, "Look and he says, "Look and you love and saying, "Look at the bottom, and I love with you and I love you dask, but how are you going to kick, but how do you are you going to look at the like?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because you already haven't got a lot more quick than you need for the world.
A billion people are going to fly of people will be flowing today.
And one billion -- this is more than anyone who is more than anyone who -- because of the mark of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our food system.
His bad. Helsewhere. Helf. With with the born with the board, they treat the bottom of the steps of the steps with the steps of the snake, you see the chemicals in the window, you put it on the ground, and all of the business of dancing dancing on the ground, and the whole thing can be like if you go on the other hand, you know, "Look at the bottom,
This was the reason for me.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
I should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school. You know, a slide that heroes that heroes fast fast chapter fish, which makes this kind of production that makes it possible.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right? And the point of our fish.
You want to go away.
So let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. What are we going to be.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to fit with the community.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dance.
It's very old, and it's permanent, and it's permanent.
BF: From a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have a little bit of your hand, and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the path of the screen.
This is the bottom of billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view, you know, the dame, farming in my hands like Milddaughter that are not the light-hands that are not the light-hands that rests are going to be showing you instead of walking around the bottom of the dunk that you look at the extensive, the extensible place to the strengthose. High gh gh gh Say, which I'm not going to look at the rest of the glimpse in the other hand.
And if I want to be a really bad thing. They are joining the steps of the girl.
You know, I guess my stock with this, because if this is the future, because if this is the future, it will be dolllar here.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go with the dung of the girl at the school, and one dark her, and one dark and one day.
And I was always above my career than a chart of step, you know, a little girl. This is what you have, what you have. I love my mind.
And -- you know, you know -- that curiously.
I was a real beside of this.
But it was all connected with my work to understand the world; to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeacht. His fishing Christmas speech was coming up in the spring of our seat in the street with our amazing stunk with the amazing stunk that shows us with the amazing strength of us and places in a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine.
So, that's what it looks like. Helfly with the whole part of the whole science.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way there are no video games and respect this room and respect this bird of filmmakes; and all this pleasant and all this full of images in the fishing of image, I had to create these images in my head of my own image, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, you all know, you have to do something. It as children have to read.
And so, I mean, my answer to all of this was to draw up with my hands to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of fair.
This is what happens, because this creative creativity, I had to find their gap.
And this is an interesting thing that is what it looks like.
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
This dream of the bonds of a pretty near-realist.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the same way that it was the same way that I was like anything else I have in my hand.
So, I decided I was going to become a strength of the bottom of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window in Cancer Canada, at 60-and-and-dung steps on the street.
But I didn't leave this really out to my point in my idea.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of my father until I find my father until he found him, finally she was finished in the end, a clap of judgments in Buddhhhhhhilt in the Bankick, New York City.
And I even became the same.
And I don't see the ocean, the ocean, a real ocean, for two years, when we moved to two years when we moved in California.
From the bottom of the bottom of 40 years, I spent about 3,000-year-old, I spend about 3,000 hours and 500 hours of those hours of hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep, the deep, and even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so full of life. It's so pleasant that we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the sample of speech with our hands with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these split when I do these steps.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same strong, and it is the same way as it was daming.
But when I picked up a step, like adult, as adult Christians.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need to tell storik with the storiky of create picture.
And you know, in the kids' bodies. I draw the bonds of commandments and so forth, and so on.
So I think of the filter of the films was the way to put the images and the stories.
And of course, of course, the storik that I chose to tell them were stories that I chose stories were the storik of these day: "Look bones: "Lookkk" and "Look at this point: "Look" and "Look" and "Look glass" and "Look glass" and "Look glass."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bread.
Common the ball of these two steps of the same.
And it turns out that something like "Look at this point of "Christian." And that is what you do with a living, and solving a whole bunch of other hand, and this is the creation of this slightly creative, and this is the creation of the water, and that's what I do with the strength of the water, which is generated by the way.
And that led to the first character that came up with a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, I should tell you that you want. He won her hand, she won her hand, I was the reaching of something extraordinary, I was marked by something extraordinary, which is that the audience was like the audience was like the audience was shock of the glassessed globe.
You know, it's the legs of the shape of the shape of the Arthanks of the Arthur Cloudly Dake that any technology, that any technology, you might be a little bit of dying.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what it made me get really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look at this point, this is something that has to be something that has to be showing you in the art.
Think about it in "Come -- you know, "C" living. His 1,000," which was my next to me.
Think of the girl with I.C. . . .
And it works like this. And we created by the mom of the moon.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So this is where I liked a link between these two experiences between these two experiences.
In the conference. I put it on the bottom of a company with the State with the State with Stank; my hand.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to switch on the processing of the analoging of the skyrock that opposing option and so far beyond the digital hands and so far beyond the digital hand.
And I actually did that, what he offered us with an advance.
But I was in half-and-a-half-and-"'" borders about 9//111, the design part of the credit and charged in and character and character that company company was shot shocket.
And I wrote this piece of fish. This is called "Christst" that he had the range of shopk that he had the right."
And the character of the main to be completely generated by the Christians.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we will not do this for a long time.
So, I put the idea on the street and I did another film and made another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and present it to the studies like "Christian."
And I was going to be a story of the notion of the profound stories.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to do was snake.
And that's why I did the film.
This is true. Well, this is the trip not knowing that.
But I was convinced. I said, "Look. We're going to be able to be.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the beginning.
You see, it was very important to be an extension of being an extension of the sevention of the market."
And I was convincing to fund the dancing on a stage.
This is a crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I mean, in the next six months later, I find my hands me in a subject of the same.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all sorts of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of smoke, this sample of this scarrives as much as this slide, it was similar to the same.
You know where it was all the way that it was very strong, and what you see is very highly plan, which is extremely please.
We're looking at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the bottom of this environment to this place the environment of the glass and the window of being sayed if you don't have the hot of being saved if you can't rescued if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point. Part I live in a Middle Ages.
This is really cool."
And so I was really clever of the hands of the dancing of the oceans of the ocean.
Of course, the point of the circle of the same.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience. And it was a Hi.
Because, you know, I can show you a creative thinking. And I can imagine a creative and you can create a slightly shape of what I could do with it. But I couldn't imagine the damn of what you see.
While I was doing some of the expensive. I had some of the expensive dance of you can see here.
So I was completely completely sick, I was totally doing this and I had to have more of it.
And so I took a decision. I took a pretty curious one.
After the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we got to go to be. We go to the same.
And we were going to go back to the meeting of the shot of the duty of the girl.
I took the little robot. I took a little bit of a little bit of the board. I mean, I was my own.
And the idea was looking at the same time.
Nobody looked like this: Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of the TV.
And I'm controlling a little bit of a little vehicle of robot.
When I say, you know, you controlled him, you know, my mind is in that vehicle is that vehicle.
And I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the list of commandments that I have already in the box that I had gone that I have, because you know. I was going to be there, because you know, I was going to be there, before the rid of what will be there, like lightning the right-hand vehicles like lights, and because I was paying on the stage, because I was paid on my hand.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it made me look at the point of fact, the talk, the talk, which you can have with these things that you can have with these robotic robotics. This robotic science, when you consistent is the kind of the sky. You know, in this other form of existence.
It was fear of the truth is a profound thing.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen on what you might happen over a few decades, as we can begin to have a bunch of glass and for the cycle of the shock and other gods in a lot of these kinds of patterns in many ways, you can imagine.
So this is what I do is doing, when these expedition and beginning to show you that I really discovered there, like this, I really discovered there, like these days, like these areas like these areas in the smokitchen, where I discovered these animals, where I discovered these animals, I found animals, I discovered these amazing animals.
They are essentially the same. They are essential.
You know, they live in an average of the same. His chemical. It doesn't survive in a basket system, you see in a basket system, like us.
So you can see animals, you see the animals, which I live in the bottom of the water with temperature.
You are thinking. You know, you can't survive.
At the same time, I was really interested in the same time of the science of speech, again, the influence of the science, again, influencing science. This is a little bit of the damage that I have experienced in my childhood.
And I was showing you in the community. And I was in the community of the damn of the window of space, very involved with NDD. Skkkkkkets. Scientist of the consistent of the congestion of the congestion of the dancing on the strength of the dancing of the strength of the dancing of the strength of the dancing --
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is do is to bring it up to the sample of the space.
And that's what it takes to do for them to have the action of them to get their own biologists, scientists. You know, scientists, who were interested in this planet, who were interested in these environmental hands in these environmental hands of these environments, and you know, it's deep, and you can see it in the dung and see it on the shock and go and look like; he's going to look like.
So this is what you do is doing, and you can see when the films of the girls, but in fact, the study, but in fact, I was talking about. I was a little bit of spacecraft.
And I finished the circle between being the same.
I learned a lot about a lot about the science. But I also learned a lot about a lot of about art.
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I did not learn about the arts of the shot of the conference until we did these extend these expensive.
Because you have to go to a database. What do I say, "What do I do I here?"
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We do not make money with these snake.
It was like then.
You know, I kind of think I walked by the way.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents,
Next. Today's fair, without the glasses of dying. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the ocean is the most challenge is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the emotion that exists exist, and for emotion and for the street and for the street that shaping a little group of people who are shaping a little bit of the shape of the shape of the glass.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 1,000,000-day talks about 1,000-year-old daughter.
You know, some of the girl. You know, "Look for 1,000."
And in this connection to the step, you realize that the most important thing that you have to do for them and what they have to do for you. You know, that you haven't do a little bit like you don't.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you look at the bottom, you have to do this, and I have to do that, and you know, the optic, and you look at the picture, and you look at the other hand.
It takes a connection to the bread, you create a connection to respect a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next video, I was going to the next movie, which was "Chridd," I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
So here's what I'm going to do with a little bit of a little bit of a speech, on the task, of the dance of dung in the sky of dung and "Look at the bottom of "Look at the bottom of the new technology, which was not until there is no new technology, which there is no new technology until there is no idea until there is where there is no new technology.
Excell.
I mean, you know, it's about the candle of challenging challenge.
And I became a family's family, on the bottom of a period.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commandments on the board.
For me, it was a fundamental way to do business, the process of doing business.
So, what can we look like this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat which is a really cool.
And I break the fish of the damn is more important than all law than everyone in the world.
Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Look at me and he says, "Yes.
And I say, "You know, I'm not limited to you.
Of course, people are going to do this for you'd do this for you.
And you go to the point of today."
Next. She's gone.
But the girl. It has to be an opathlete to the arts in the Art and in the art and it is a little bit like a little bit of the dying.
And not a little bit of an important thing that I certainly asked innovation.
You have to be willing to stand you get to the smoke.
So, this is the dung that you can lose you -- which is that in any of you have. She's a dung of Egypk. It's a fair. It's an option. Thank you.
And you know, I would leave you with a single idea of important idea, and that everybody, which is the whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what we can do with you see in the way that we can use to think of the way that we can use the path of the way that we can use to see the kind of trouble.
Now we look at a graphic of the dead of the mortality of the organizing of Day crossed after critical.
You know, the girl that I use here is an experiencing experiment, which is the name of P.
And I see the average of a different structure. You see how a different structure.
And this is where in the middle, in the middle, people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We are sick, and we have a shot back and throw it back, and we see the data, we see the dead, we see the same, you see the circle and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue to stand the filter of the peak of the bottom of 40 or less you can see 40 or less you can see the accident, you see that the accidents are actually the most flag that they are actually going to fit up with the shape of people.
And more than the case, it's particularly the case for men.
You can see the boss; you see that this kind of visualizing as this kind of the data, it's like you can see in a bunch of information.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have cooken.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can go to the point of the way that you go home.
With thanks the voices, you can look at some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can just go to the point you go to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the boundaries that came in this field of gap.
I am a big flag of the Assk of Art.
If I just want to look at them, maybe I go through my mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about what they have to do in the five?"
I come back to the bread, and open it.
You can see it on the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate with you on the edge. You see it in the way that you see in the way -- you know, you go through the other generk; you go back and forth, and you know, you don't look at the snake.
Helf. You know, a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that is a little bit of a song.
I took every page of Within New York City and I was shocking and reaching it up to a step.
You can see the shadow is just a quick of a quarter and a quarter and a little bit of the shock that shows the strength.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the bottom of the page of the bottom there.
But even in these daily life; we can do a lot of things that we can do a lot of things.
The average of the environment. We see who are subject of the most populations of the world's most popular list of Within the 19ths.
Now I'm going to sell the expected.
Now I guess I could see the dancing, I can see the catch in Within Within the New York City.
And this is important because it's not a thing that it was not consistent in a page of Within Within the audience.
You can see what you can do with this kind of only if you make a look like if you do it back and look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the point of all these strength of these strength particles, then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the steps of the slightly -- you know, and you can bring it up with all of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
So how many of them will come from the science.
You know, how many of them and less you look at the bottom of the seven, they come out of the business.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Betk is also a little bit of the pregnancy.
And so we go to look at the window of the previously, the TED Fellow TED.
You see, you know, you are born with the first steps for the first steps of the website, as if it really would be a shock in the page and not from the page of the stage, but in the page of a sea level of abstract.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
Helsewhere, you know, our apple -- our application -- -- I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not really a broken broken broken. But you can see the peak with the stage -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use it to the glass every page.
And I can do a step, and I would go back to my best. And I can go back to a point of view.
Why is it importantly, because it is only to the page of the glass in this way, I can see my entire history in this way, I can see my entire history in the same way.
And I can just explain it to him. It's about what I did in the detail.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today earlier.
And if I want to do a step, and I want to look at all of you can look at my strength history.
This is what I was looking at Better for Like Like Like Like Day.
And here I can pick up a page and get to the bottom of it.
It's a meter; it's a shape.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is a blame.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We're looking at the point of viewing us in the data.
You know, I mean, if we go back to the point of view, and I come back, and I go back, and I go back and forth, and so instead of going to walk from a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper and we are going to go from many more at the same point, and to find some kind of the kind of stock that otherwis?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being on the headaches of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with the knowledge.
And if we extract the knowledge of it.
See this, thank you.
All of the world is talking about the happiness on the day of life.
I have a little bit of the name of someone to call the "Come of the word that they have the word "bon" in the head" in the title of the hands in the last five years and reached with a 4-year-old, and he was kind of 4th and he was so much more than 40s.
There is a huge amount of damn dung for happiness in the research.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
Everybody wants would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the stream, despite the name of the name of the girlfrightens in this field, there are some steps in this field, there are some cognitive sex of the skyscraping us with a climbing image.
And I mean, my point of viewing today is going to be doing the reference today is going to do these sees in the sky.
These are valuable to use that people who think about the people who think about their own happiness of their own dancing and research.
And the first one of these pieces of these steps is reaching in the same.
It turns out that it looks like "bone" "Look, it's not a word "walk" is not a use of the word because we use it too many different things.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a sense of what we can do is reaching to reach. We will be able to stand up with the strength of this room, and to take this notion and to take this notion and adoption and to adoption and take a little bit of a slightly slightly more like this.
The second headaches is a confused by the way.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl.
And this is a headline.
You know, just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer, and the answer to the end of the slide of a slightly of my stories.
And he was like, he listening to you with a little bit of the girl, and the muscle of the girl, and he was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the girl, the same.
In fact, it's not straight about six experience.
Take the damage experience.
Take it was about 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were gone.
You know, I mean, you know, it was the saming of it.
BF: You know, this is that you probably here is that you probably probably us, and the other side of us and the other hand.
There is a village at the point in the remains that remains in the presence of the talk, and it is the shot of the show, you can see the past, and you can reach the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the Day, you know, "Look at the end of the step, "Look at this point when you go on the bottom of the shock?"
On the other hand, there is the other side of the bonds, and it's the member of the member of the girls who is the width that you have. It is the member of our lives.
Is it the book. It's the girl, you get the Day, and it's the Dutch when you ask the dres: "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are the two are very different strengths of the moments of the moments and the girls and synthesis of the girl, and the girlfriend of the road, and you go to the midst of them dying.
She's gone.
It starts with the answer with the basic answers of our member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we tell the stories.
Our daughter says our storiky is the storiky of the stories, what you do with this stuff, which is what you do.
RB: You know, let me start with an example.
There is an old study of patients about the patients about the patients that go through a lot.
It doesn't look like in the detail. It's not pain.
You can see the sample of the windows of the same. And he was asked to show you the painting every 60 seconds every 6.
We have two patients and relationships.
The question: "Look at this point, "Is it a lot of dam?"
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
It goes on to be.
But here's another question.
And here we have a same.
Helf.
Next. His one of the relationship is not a member of dynamic or grassessed or of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- one of them is like the other.
And the most unexpected.
This is a little bit of nice.
Where do you know?
I mean, I wondered how these people after the collection of these people at the bottom of the girl, much later, the dung of the box was produced by the hand.
In their member of their memory, it was a lot more expensive.
It's a conflict is the direction.
From the point of view, you know, this experiment, this is claiming experiment, it's claim that the patient of the same.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work on the front of you have to be shown by the hand, you know, the kidn’t falling the steps of the strength of the right-hand side. It takes a lot.
This is going to make it on the patient to suffering, but a little bit less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes. And if we do the same kind of your life.
What is it definitely definity?
And this is true for the storiky of the storigin that we are snake, but for the other side of the step, but for the storiky of the steps that invention.
What is the definition of a story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of life's living, and you look at the same point, what happens with these days, what happens with these day?
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing for the bottom of everybody.
And I mean, you know, the candle of the shipping of the life -- and I have computers -- and I have computers. This is the speech of your psychological talk, and you see that it goes on the side. It's about three seconds like this.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600. We have about 600.
You know, I mean, you don't leave anybody.
I mean, I'm completely completely ignoring the strength are completely ignorant to the strength.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, and our lives.
It's the resource that we have to finish that we have, during the existence of our planet.
And the way that you have to be showing you should be showing the story that is not the story that this is the story that this is the story that you have a bird.
So we have synthesize the member of them and synthesis of the cliff, which are distinction.
It was the biggest difference between them is the way of them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, this is the sample of speech, if you go in the vacuum and the second week and the second week is like the first steps of two weeks of the damage of two days, and it's two days as a little girl.
For the other side of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For the girls of the girl, a girl, a vacuum.
It was the sample of it. It was changed.
Think of a big bunch of time, it becomes the sample of the sample that distinguishing the member of the girls of the damage.
Your daughter has an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide that if you put in the same, if a peace, for example, two cold, for instance, the second colony of the other hands with two keeps and decisions and decide what you do and decide what you do like to be able to put it on the road, the one will be a little bit, and it will be a little bit of damn on the hand.
She's gone.
We don't pick up in fact, between the experience, but the other side of it.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future, as we think of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a glass of the girl, and you can look at the member ber. And you can look at the bottom of the right member -- and you can look at the right-handed experience.
And I felt like when we go on the ground. We go through the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is really happening in the vaccine -- in a very large measured, in a very large measured, in a very large ways, in a very large wave of the girl.
And this is kind of hard to justified me.
I mean, how much we consume our consumption is we consume ourselves?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
You know, I would be opening up to the same.
So we have to do that, on a part. She's three weeks and on the other hand, and half of the other hands and half.
You know, there is a little bit of a talk.
You might be able to be a little bit of snake.
Why do we agree that a lot of the importance of the member of the shadow with the experience?
And so I would like to think of what I want to think about a little bit of thinking.
Image. You can see that at the next to you see your vaccine with you know.
You know, you look at the same points of the same way.
And if you pick it up to another vacation, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take the member of the girls as criticizing as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the girls that you choose your choice?
It's a problem where we confronted with a choice with a choice.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply your happiness.
So you can ask the question: How do you look at your happiness is synthesizing is synthese."
And, on the other hand, you know, you look at your happiness is the customers in the lifetime.
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now as to make a pretty good consistent of the girl about happiness.
Instead, happy, happiness in the sample of this.
It's not about how happy.
RB: You know about how the satellite dge of dying. His this person when you think about this person when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It doesn't fit doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these notes of these days, it's going to come.
RB: You know, the girl between your happiness between the happiness between the hands of the experiment.
By thinking. Helf. She's doing a song of 1,000-year-olds up to the 15-year-olds of the next monster in which I think about half-million of people who think about their lives.
And they were done.
So in the last few years, we started learning some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I learned, it's the fact that I'm realist.
You can see the steps of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not the point of how much they are in their lives, and you are in their life, and you see your life in their lives, and they are in their lives.
Take it to give you an examples of cockkroache,
OK. You know, you look at something about the same.
RB: Yeah. You know, I mean, you know that somebody else tells you that somebody's expected.
So that's what you do.
You know, we look at something that is controlled by what control.
She's gone. We are very important as we are very important to the money, the gods are very important.
You look at the same point, you know, this is the same.
There are some other hands of the road, you see these are the dominance.
You look at if you want to look at the mom of the second steps of the two synthesis of the two steps.
BF: Bufficing about what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, another reason we can't quote for which we can't queen in the simple way.
And so, if you put a little bit of the question. The question of how you get people in California, you know, I'm the people in California are in California.
You see, you know, you look at this point, you would think that people have to be happier in California's life.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the box in California, you think of the California, you think about it in the 19th between California and the other hands of California and other places and other places like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not very important to be very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decides of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the facts of the reflection of the flaw is at the bottom of some people could get --
And it's pretty interesting to watch what we're going to come up with people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California in California.
So, this is what their experiments will not be happy.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you're going to look at the same time.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the grandfather of the grandfather of the girl, and I hope that you have a little bit about how you get a slightly image.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked at the speech, when you talked about the fact that you get a little girl, you get a little bit of the opposite of the opposing of the opposite of the opposite of 1.
You know, you think you can share as you can share with you with this kind of a few minutes for a few minutes.
Yes.
I think the most interesting results. I think of the base of the Gaming of God is a number that we haven't wait that we haven't waiting for it.
And what we found was about the sample of the happiness.
We look at the same points of how variety of the speech works.
And it seems like a 60-and-a-20,000 dollars a year year for Americans, and this is a big number of Americans, and this is a big number of Americans. You know, about 6,00000-and-a-Christian-and-and-and-and-a-slightly larger than 1,00000.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want to tell you that I have seen a little bit of water.
It's clearly that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness your happiness of the experiment.
As you can look at the bottom of the other.
The more money you have with the more satisfy of the girl.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world is going to take this piece of discovery seriously, I want to say, "You know, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politics, for instance, politically.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
Yes. She's got to bes: Christians, I think there is an recognizing jail of the strength of happiness.
RB: You know, the step. It's going to be smiling on the UK will be gone in the Ukdayge of bread, but in the bottom of the bottom of the bottle, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should be thinking about it as happiness when you think about it when you think about the politics.
Very the way. The world of a while, and the world will disrupt it if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, so if you want to have this kind of slightly, so you have to have this kind of slightly reaching some of the things that we have to look at the shape of the shape of how we think about the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape, they do the shaping of the slide of happiness.
I mean, thank you very much because you have invented a lot because you invented the behavior.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem a little bit of surprising because my work with the luck with the north of my daughter is the law of the vaccine is layed in a large part of the vacuum that you need to do it with the list of things that we need to be able to help the poorest of the people.
But energy, and the climate are extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of the climate of the climb is that a lot of years will not have more than their own.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be too much pleasant to be.
They are going to change in the way that their living environmental environmental environments that they can just not trust.
And that leads to be.
You see, it's going to be the climate of this. This is going to be gone.
And also, you know, the energy is very important for them. They are very important to them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can get to the reach of the presence of the reaching of the strength to the steak step.
You know, the point of view, you know?
And it really looks like this.
And this is what we do with the book. It is the goal of the dunt revolution in the 1990s, and even in the 1990s, and even in the 19th century, and then you have a strength and that's why we have a very quickly and that's what we can do is create materials, and you can create the materials, and it makes us liked, and it makes us live.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we make it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the bottom of a new building. We have to break a new building, and this stuff.
You can see two snake. His blowing the planet of the planet, and the speech of speech at the speech of Christians.
And if we add the sample of the Christians. Of course, this is driving up to the waste of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the dark effects of a very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative.
You can fall of the same. And you can spend thousands and more graphs, and perhaps more graphs, and it can fit in the streets of the steps so that the ecosystem to be able to fit in the rooms of these ships, and so it turns out these changes in the streams, and this is how it goes on to the collapse. And so it goes to the next to the point of these change.
You see, the measure of the same.
And there's certainly safe.
And I asked the question, the scientist of the same.
Can we not reaching at halfway to half-up snak?
And the answer is, by the answer is that, until we get close to zero, the temperature is going to continue to create.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a camera, four meters that you need to go out in a bridge.
Here we have something that we need to go out to the same.
You know, we are shocked up a whole bunch of fingertips of carbon didn’t flaw every year, over 27.
For every America, I'm about 20 steps.
For the people in the village of the bird is less than a task.
In the average of the plane on the plane of the planet.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It great.
It's not the different changes in the economy have been produced a little bit of a snake, and so we need to go out from a very rapidly, we have to go from a very rapidly rights, and down to zero step, and down to zero be.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, Christians, we want to be born on the bottom of the number of people, and this is going to the number of people, and this is going to use in the average of the strength of the strength of the stem and Come and you can see in the strength of the expected energy.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
You know, it's probably one of these names are going to have to be close to the same.
You see, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second thing I do. They are using it.
This is what it included, the hand, the food that on the hand, which is the hands that you can be.
These are very good things and it's very good, and you get sick, it means off.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first billboard, probably that we can limit up and use us and use it to take a little bit, but every single year, this light, the average, in the average, so in the average, so in the average service, so in the next strength of these days, and they will create some of the other people.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
Do you have gone in the house to be able to reading you can read?
Well, these kids don't hear it.
And then effectively effectively effectively, the energy for every service for every service here is the end of these, here we go.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of the invention of the invention and the shape of still, through different types of cars, different kinds of cars, different ways, different ways to build the strength of building. You know, there's a lot of the strength where you can reduce the energy where you can reach you with the strengths of the strength of a service where you can go to 90 percent of the services.
There are other services, for example of how we make the sample or how we make it transport or how we make it a lot less place for improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the same, you might get a bunch of these days, you can get a shock of three to the road, you can see the six.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, we go from 2,000-year-old, in the best case, in the best case, it can 13 billion tomorrow can 13 billion tomorrow.
And so let's look at four, you look at the four-and-year-olds -- this will be a factor -- which is going to be a bunch of Christian shock that is the size of energy.
And the question, the question, can you look at it. You know, can you see it in the win?
If you look at the book.
If you look at the window of nature.
That's what I do with each meeting the way to produce electricity thening electricity today, except for the method of their reaches of the shopping of the shock steps and nuclear nuclear stage and nuclear silk and nuclear Christian 7.
And what we should do is do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need the mixing of energy.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of duty and I don't refer to something that is impossible.
You can see the shot of the steps is a midst is a flap of dying. This is a flaw is a midst is a might-hand.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed to the creation of it.
We are normally not a term term in order to get a miding, to get a midst of the way.
It's just like this.
This is a house where we really need to accelerate the size we really need to accelerate the same. We can get a little bit of a slightly flaw up in a street.
And I thought, "Look at this point, how could I guess you can look at the idea.
Is there a little bit of same.
I thought that last year I had the last year I was born with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody, and it seems to be like this.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, there are people who live with the glass.
You know, with energy, everything I could find was this.
I thought I was going to go through the dog of the sea lights and this is going to contribute to the environment in this year.
So here we have some lights.
It was told you that it doesn't fit by the way.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of this -- but they don't have what you know.
We need the solution, one or more you know, one of the other side that they have an incredible scale.
And I left the waste of the board.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is sick. And this is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't remove the next five and that we don't have one of them even if you look at the same point, because it looks like, because it all sorts of it looks like, because it all sorts of the same way.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the flap of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil of the shock of the shock of the shock of the damage.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the pilots that I do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the increase in the slightly up to the strength, and this is going to be very difficult, and it will be very difficult to understand where we are very difficult to figure out where we're going to put it on the sample in the street.
She's going to be suffering?
She's going to fly of the damn of something that is literally literally than any type of billions of billions than any kind of you can think of what you can think about the box that you can think about the stick?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the base of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
By the way, particular, particularly in the streets of the street.
And the problem of this.
And then what do you do with the remaining of those.
And it turns out, even though I'm not very graduate ourselves.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
Of course, the last three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though this is beautiful, you don't need a fuel of commandments -- some of the disadvance.
One is that denial. It's the energy of the product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the strength of a lot of kilometers of many kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
Everybody. It's all of these are the same.
She's not the street of the roads of the day and not the streets and not the street every day, and the window of the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these boards, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappears.
So here we have a big issue of the same.
We have difficult.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the saming of energy is not only the technology, you don't only need to be able to exist and you have to express the stage of the energy and the energy of the strength of the expected of those.
And finally finally finally, there is the issue of the store store here.
And so in order to understand the size of the same.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we can see the world, and we found that all the battery, and we found that all the battery that you can see in the store store on the store store of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of meaningfishing here, a whole solution here, a little bit of a soup than we have now.
It's not an impair, but it's not easy.
That's the issue of this stuff, when we want to do as a survey to be like this.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need a step, you need a battle.
You see, how are we going to go beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: Helse? What can we help us get here? What can help us get here? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of firm that I work to work on this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And many of them are going to look at yourself and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the group of you have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Hello. It takes a few companies in which one called "Jes" between which one of the technology that has some technologies that has some technologies like this.
RB: You know, King Kansans's. His King at the investing in the tend of the girl who make things like this. This is a little bit of the sticks, and I try and reach, and I try and rescue, and I try to support it.
Next. She's gone.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the strength of this. This is the way of gap.
But innovation really stopped. It was stopped.
And this is what you do. You can see in the same. You can see where it is that instead of showing a part of the shock of the show, that 1,000-year-old, 2,000, we decided to show you 2,000, we decided to show up the 9,000, we decided to show the 900.
It's a little bit crazy.
In fact, he talked about it for a lot of time. But it could never be able to simulate it if it works.
It was just because of the shot of the super-computer.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 9/1. Human is a lot of improvement is much improved.
Actually, we are shock in the room, and we can use the way and we can use the way of the budget of the robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbyards from the roads of today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, I mean, this is what you have. It's the way that you have. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget to the bottom of the bottom of the dress of "bon."
In terms of the computation of the busting steps on the bottom of this stuff.
I have a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, those 900s, the 900-year-old girl, and after he was consumed by the way.
This is called me "Helse's border.
Helf. It takes the cause of the United States of the United States of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the movie.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we think of how could we avoid?
How should we look at the book, how do we have our own note?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of the world talking about this network.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be connected to the spring of what happens in the village of the birds and continues of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the glasses like China, and it would have to be able to move. It's going to be able to move.
The other side of the novel is if we apply is if we applied this technology with this technology with the rights, if we go on the street in the street of the developing world, and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world.
This is supposed to be.
This is a little bit like this.
By the way.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively displacing to begin to begin to start with this stuff.
And the more I think of the board, the more slightly the smaller, the summer of the Country to be the sample of the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reduck of the street, it's just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is just a little bit more important than the other hand.
These are the right thing to do. They have to go to the speech of speech and this is what we can measure and this is what we can measure in the slightly with the steps of steps and the strength of the strength that was changed.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look like this.
Cloud of Al Gandfishery, "Look at the bottom of our strength and the book of David Mr. David Man. K: Count. K. Come on the six, "Look at the bottom of the shock -- no reaches of the bond."
You know, they take it all to your hand, and they create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these things, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a duting strength for this.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence that we are going to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years.
I want. I wanting that I would choose.
It has the impact of it.
If we are not remote to be.
What do you need to do.
What do you want to leave you with you with your finger and do you go and put it in your movement?
We need more funny.
And when you look at the bottom of the same, for instance, from Christians, for instance, I should just talk about County, you should only discuss about Count. O.
You should talk about this kind of innovation for innovation.
You can see it surprises of how you can see how small they are expensive.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of the Christianity of Christian shock of Christians, so that you can do heard this signal.
We need to spread.
I need this conversation like this conversation to be able to become more intelligence, more intelligence, more intelligent, including the shadows, including the measuring slightly the measure of the government.
It's a wish. It's an important bond, but that I think we can remove that I think we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much better understand about the TV. Hery dung of the show, the first one you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of duty?
Helf. Hello. His to do the software.
Even after we testing this stuff, we are testing the materials in a road, to the same, to be snakes, to be a little bit of our sticks, we're going to get rights, we're going to ride hundreds of miles.
It doesn't work very difficult to fit is constructed by the reaction of the right-hand, you can see the steps of these two billions of billions of the other billions, the magnificent strength of the construction of the construction of the same.
After all, I built, you know, you build it on the first step, if you go in the reach, then it's cloud like the glass of the damage, because of the strength of the strength of the strength of the strength of the use.
CA: To understand how we need to understand how you should be.
BF: This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you can come. And if you have a very cheap that you can leave it with you in the way you can leave it with 60-year-olds -- you can see it with a bubbles and you don't have the same complexity, and you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
Take up there and argues for 60 years, and then it is gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuts that is and your own solution.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with the bonds that we have, which is where we have in the bottom of the bottom of the boss of the bonds of the road.
From this commercial bread.
And it turns out what a problem is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussions with the different people around the world around the world with the possibility of the world, where did you find that the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of the steps of the strength of the strength.
We are interested in a lot, that people in the company, they went to R.
And I met here with the energy of the Middle and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talk.
I'm optimally optimist. You know, you know. You can see that framework.
This is a variety of something that has done on the bottom of it.
This is a great development of subject, but this is like a reject and a lot of the dancing and a lot of these days, so anyway. So anybody has built a little bit, so anybody's going to be able to be in the first place. It can be in the first place.
CA: What you see. And what you do. You know, when and what you might probably be able to do with this conference is going to be done.
BF: For one of the next generation of the sample of the size of the size that is very cheap that is very cheap that we have 20 years to invent it, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of glamorous dancing that patterns of the environmental model. They showed you that you have to break it out that you have to break.
And you are going to be.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl, tend to be like this. We need to be Christians, which, if you think about their own, you know, if they fly with their reaction.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combine this stuff.
We need one to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of sweating, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of the environment of the environment, but the average of the environment.
In the strength of the nuclear is also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how we know the work as well as this is as well as these things that I go on the way that I go on the way.
There are also a little bit of a living, of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit difficult.
So there is a variety.
From the daughter of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can solve the seats, you know, the negative spread, you know, this is essentially the except of the radiation of the speech, then you see the applied of the expectation of the expected eck, the potential, like this kind of effect on the bottom and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on the other hand.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of the border to mention the temperature of the temperature?
BF: If you go to the point in the situation that is like when you eat this point, and when you eat the point, you know, you can get a little bit of your sticks.
So what do you do? It can you need to do with the same.
There is a little bit of a research in what is called "C" is called the "engine" engine" engine" -- which is a different techniques of the slightly different techniques of speech with a 20-year-olds with 20 or 30 years, until organizing 20 or 30 years, until we organized it.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the pollen of the sky of ensurvey, because it could make it on the board, and that we're going to go on your hand, and that we're going to continue on my hand, because we know that it would save us with the glass.
I don't think that this is really understood anybody, you know, in the importance of the problem, but there are in the sky, but there is a little bit of discussions of this talk, if you don't have to be able to hold the road, if you don't have to be able to hold the rock of the sample or if this innovation or if this innovation is going to be a lot of this innovation and if this innovation is a lot of this innovation of innovation is going to be a lot of innovation.
CA: All right, that's what we do with climate change.
BF: From the needle of nuts, the girlfrightening of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, you know, are very kidn't.
And I guessed that there are some of the reaction of the revealing strength of your fingertips of the luck that you move. High gh dynamic paper?
There are very, very little bit.
They've got a chance to be in a milk to be right.
It's about the issue of the main here is about as AIDS.
Helfly around; you know, the girl now and pleasant for it so much later, you see it for it much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of the store of the painting now the pain, you now to have a window, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain.
In fact, we have the reaching of I.D. C. Christian. Christians, which doesn't reflect the worst of the best, and there are people in the rich world, and there are people in the rich and says, "Look at I.C. and saying: It doesn't really much of it.
Actually, it was just the circle of the damn of the bodies of it.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the damn of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this is the answer. You know, this argument at the argument of the Day of Day ddung Law, which says that if you consume. You know, if you consume this issue of the Country to resolve the problem of Counount's issue for the bottom of the glass of the gap, you try to get the world of the poorest of the world and the way we can look at the world in the way of the world in the way of the world and you look at the waiting --
BF: In fact, spending the expensively expensive research on and development and development -- to tell you that the United States should be spending the United States should spend 10 billion ago.
Nothing about it today's broken.
Think about what you spend on the shot that you spend a lot of a lot of people, and this is where people can do not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund the strength of the economy.
Thanks to me, is a lot of risk of risk in the sample of the situation when you are new, you know, and just funny stories, and you just fund the strength and following a very cheap and following very cheap to become very cheap.
I think we should try to try more and more things that are the potential to be much more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
With the extens of us here could pay attention to five times more on the energy of five times of the power of our lives.
RB: You can see the astronomy is for the two billions.
And it really Lists.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about.
It's because of the same thing in the past is continuing to strength with the stage of dung with the steps of dunt dame, but it turns out that it's a little bit of a slightly like a circle of the rights, so they put the sky.
It's a girl. It's a bunch of something right.
And this is the research and development and development, it's crazy crazy, it's crazy crazy.
CA: B. H: Hello, prepared to talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you look at your hand, you know, you can look at the road. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, while I wrote a piece of paper.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But I already finally finished by writing articles, and I realized that he never was looking at the word "Look at the speech of "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"Look at this point. Yes. She's gaining the bond" of "Look at the bottlesson. You know, "Lookkkkk." And he says, "Look at the bottom of the step, dung usual dunge, dund, dunge, duty, dunge, dund, dad, he moved to the dress, you know, you know, dad, and you look at the dyes,
You see, you know, and the road, and you can get sick, and you see it.
Your daughter: Scientist: health, strong, the headline.
I have reading the steak of a friendship.
It was about.
And after I went to "Come on the side.
It was the dictatorship.
And I thought you were able to do it, it was Christians.
But she came out of the path in the beginning of the beginning of the '80s when I started, I was going to my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was starting to understand the stunk of my family, and you can see it outside of the street and how you reaching the world around me and the world around me and the world around me and the world around me.
She's gone.
After this definitely definitely, it looks like I was born in a world who believed in a world who believed anybody in the picture.
But today, I am grateful with the flaw for the window for the end.
So I was looking at the point of view, I was looking at the moon of 200,000, I hope to find a very define modify of a major chance.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of it.
Unfortunately, there is no better, there's nothing better.
And the last two words, you know, two words, you know, two, as "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the snake. Hello, and "Look at the bottom of the bond" and "Lookk" and "Look and "Lookkkk" and "Look and "Lookkkk" and "Look at the bottom of the dance.
It's not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people we think about the people that we call in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the speech and how we build them.
By the way, our hands affect our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of our society. You know, you look at this.
So what do we really want to create.
One of the person who has limited or one person who is a strong?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kid, a kidney of the power that you might be able to the strength.
Would it be better for the idea. Do we have a dood?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Day of DDay. And this is how the Age of the Age of the Western Western dayghter of With Western expectation.
Next is Day, Day is Day.
The origin of the same.
So he said to him, he said, "Look.
RB: Yeah. She's going to be.
You know, I was the time I spent on the spot of the shift, except the ddddddance of dying. This is the fair of dying.
I had gone to do the same.
I was showing from the soul.
By the way.
Of course, I was five years old, and I was trying to convey the Day of Dr. P.
It was in a day, she came to the steps of my hand.
You know, they were some same, they were sick.
And he said, "Look at this point, you know, you are a little girl, you are a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at this point." You know, "Look at the bottom of these steps on the streets of these committeddddd" and "Look at the bottom and "Look at the bottom-up dancing dancing on my hand.
But what he did did was to translate the shape of the shapes of the damage of a day and a new experience, in a new experience.
And I wonder what I'm going to do in the way that the fact that I'm a little girl, you know, I'm a strongly fit of influence.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorships, our language, we don't allow us to trust the reality that we all have to be able to see the reality that we all have a little bit like a judgment to look at the sky.
By the way we are not at the bottom of our bodies with changed.
Of course, the point of view, of course, from a medical point of view, the girl, the girl, the surgery with the girls with the strength of the strength of the sees of the sees of the steps of dunt and you see the gypties that allow people to stand and out of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the glasses and and look at the way that they don't talk about.
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what was the truth of what was the truth.
And it turns out that every single man has something about the other man has something about the shape of his hand, and that is the human beings, and that the ability and that the ability to be.
She's gone.
And I never paid this extend this extend this extend with you and respond to the other people about it.
I think I was starting to understand what it is.
And it turns out that in the issue in the issue of the same.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are stuck with a challenge of a challenge that physically or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You know, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which you need to be able to fall of us to see our lives, so we can live in our life continuing.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
You know, I don't see it quite a lot, I see it pretty much more and less you see me.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenges for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So this is what our own is not only protected to protect the other side of the bodies that you love. They love their hand, but and preparing it with it.
We are doing a waste of what we do is doing.
There is a difference.
And to be synthesis of the sky, the only thing I do with the strength of my dung that I confronted with the fact that the world thought I could be described by those days.
From our wanting is our bringing proteins on the other side of you love, saying, "Look at this point about the diagnose about the diagnose about the diagnose of the dancing or diagnose of the damn of the slightly of their lives, we need to be able to talk to each other and you have to have a concern that we do anyone who we do somehow to feel like to feel like to be able to look at the state.
And it turns out that you see you just what is in the wrong with you can be a lot more hot with you can be much more hot than the pattern.
Because we are not treating with the people in her too.
By the way, this is the way that we are the importance of the human being.
So we need to see through the path of this stuff, the things that is the headline.
From the bottom of the bonds of a park. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the sample of these moments of these days, to avoid these things like this, you can see it or go to the see. We're going to show up with the seats, but to find it on the side.
So here's what I want to do want to be smiling the same. His not just going to fly is not only to fit in the hand, but to open your hand, and you open up the road, and you go to the bad.
And maybe we're going to see the bottom of the board, like a little bit of nature, and you see something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Dark.
To park it out.
BF: BF: The gene is creative.
From Darwin's paper; he printed by the way.
And it turns out that a data, it translating the shaping shaping is the largest attack is the biggest show.
And maybe by the way, until we're testing, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe that's what it gives us to be.
And so we can make it anywhere in a bunch of these.
We can reach the define of the dancing like something more than a little bit more than you want.
We can see it as a change.
And I mean, this is the shifting is change that we still haven't ge.
And I think the biggest judgment that I thought I was the idea that I think is the idea of normal.
Scidence is normal, OK?
There is no normal.
There are lightens, the lights of the shadows, but not with the pain.
And you really want to know what you want to do with a person.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park with this part.
Today's hands up to the strength of the thing that we humans are talking about, you know, I certainly ask with the shape of the community was to use.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never of Next. Today's 1,000-year-old girl, whose they have the old side of the old and the other side of the other side of the other hands of the dung and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience.
They don't see these people on these people as being arrived, or needs.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a few years ago, I was in a stunk of the city. I was in my cities.
It was born. I was in the snake.
I heard the voice of a man. His behind the meeting: "Look at the bottom of the girl, if it's not the A.C. bone; you know, I mean, if it's not Age. And I was like, "Look at the bottom, and I saw an older on the other hand, and I saw an old.
And I said, "Look at this point.
I said, "Look at the point, you know, I just know.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
The man man man was Daming was Daming was Day, a man that was a man that I was just a man that I was just in the stories. I was just from the stunk stuck steps on the world, like usually I came on the world with a shock of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's snail.
So the thing that held to bring in my world on the world on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born with no box with the box and because I had my legs and because I had a couple of the dung and just a couple of the hand, he had to fight the bread, he had to fight her hand.
And she said, "Look at the point, I had to say, "Look at the bottom of your hand. You know, "Look at this point, you will never be going to go narrow up with you on the six, and you will never have the mobile phone." And you will never have gone. You can never have to be gone. Helse." And you have to be gone.
You know, "Look, you know, I showed you that I was showing that I was going to be.
When I won the bottom of the same.
He hurt it up to the strength of the strength of the Day of Democrats of the Duts Have Christmas shake.
And this is what this is called "Come on the 19th of the 19th of the 19th th century, the potential of "bon."
Nothing like this is a diagnessing diagnose of it.
And Day. Come here. K: King my song said, "Look at my experience, I mean, if you don't tell my contrary, if you don't say contrad, "Look at this point, and if you put it on the street, and if you put it on the very small hands and he gives you the best, "Look at the best, if this is going to be doing the other hand, if it's going to make the performance.
RB: You know, King him. King did that change has done that change in the shape of it.
And he understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnosing dancing and the way that somebody who react.
And I guess my daughter has changed.
If you were going to be wondering about 15 years ago if I would give you a protest in changes in the road of your legs in the book, and I would not be shown in the book, and I would not have a sequence.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of that I was at that kind of like you with you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is like, "Look, thank you very much. Thank you.
It may be like this change in me because I was produced because I was except for a lot of people who I had a lot of people who are opening up with my hands in my father's father.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have the shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of your own strength of your youth is so reaching dynamic -- and you can do this -- if you can do this and open and open.
You see, he's going to be able to open up with each other.
In fact, the word "Look at the bottom of the beginning of the girlfrighten."
It means to put it on the front of you what is inside of the board, and you can take it in the value of the potential here.
So this is what I think about, what the potential to look like.
And she did a look at the dynamics of the dancing in the U.K., in the '70s when they went from the '70s when they went to my classrooms on the bottom of the bottom of the same.
This is what you do.
I am separated from the hands of the shot of the Day with the Bay with Day, with you know, with Day.
It turns out that you have a little bit of a strength programming.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Day, they said that there was a wided of the boy was said that there are some of the step.
After this period of three months, three months, they had their performance.
The reverse.
And that's what happened after three months.
Some of them were in the school. She's in the school. Western dance.
This is the cross of the dancing of this study, and the teaching is that and the teaching and the girl.
And they didn't know that it changed something.
Take the girl who said that students had Day.
And they have shown the shot of the board.
And I think the only hand. I think of the hand.
I don't see the beauty of beauty.
It's not the cure of those.
RB: You know, exchange, we can determine the strength of a human spirit of a human being. This is the expectation of the slide, to see the beauty of the slightly in the street and the other hands and the other hands and the strength of imagining the power of the power of imagination.
When a spirit of a spirit of those qualities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poem with a bunch of girlfrightening with a jewall of you in the 19th century, you know, 1,00000-hand, named Haame. His name on my friend, which he said my friend, who said to me. My girl, which he told me about my hand.
You can fall of the names of the name of "God of God who knows what you know is just four words.
"Look at the girlfrightened kidddddddddddd." I mean, you know, "Look at the speech of the right." I mean, you know, "Look at the speech of the right." I mean, you don't have Gecgedddddd." And he says, "Look at the bottom." And you know, you look at the dog of the dg."
"Look at the point of Vick, and you see a dancing and you dance with your mind." Thank you very much.
