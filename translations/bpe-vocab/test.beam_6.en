Take a couple of years ago, here at TEDstage here at TEDstage of Kingdom. Christian issue called the Human named in the hand.
And the idea is quite simple.
You see the facts of four must be built by four has to build.
Helsewhere, you know, you have to stay at the top of it.
And it turns out, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that it is really harder, because the shape, the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And at that point, I have almost 70 strength of the shaming of designing around the world with my students and designing and designing and designers, and designing architecture and architecture. And the other hands of them in the top and something in this room, and something in this hand, and something from the shot and something like this is about nature's taught and some of the slightly from the way to look at the other hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: You know, you see how he imagines her -- he imagines how it will show you how it would look at the seem of the board, and then they spend a lot of the planet.
She's gone. And it goes on and throw up and throw it up to the bread.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at this point.
And there is a number of people who have a lot of the momentous momentum of "Christ."
They are the mind, the trip. She's gone.
You see, of course, there are some of the girl who have many more structures have more structures like "Christ," and they are the best, and these are the best, and they are the best, and you get the best.
And it's pretty amazing.
As you tell us thus then. You know, it's not only the proof the best, but also the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know?
And he would like to say, "I love to say, "Look at the bottom of one of the kids don't lose the time I don't lose the speech of the Skkkkkkkk."
And you don't lose the time of fight by the way.
But there is another reason.
This is that the students are training are training to cover the same.
And it turns out it out.
And what happens is that when you put on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fish, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they begin with the window is that they start with the window, and they're building dress, and they build the paper stunk steps on the bottom of the glasses of the glasses of the glamorous dges. And so they have more gone. And so they have more gone.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have an answer to the point of course of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the average, the average is about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is this? Because they understand them? Because they understand the triangle of the dung and the patterns and patterns of the geek and the stunk step. It's the kind of struck structure of the structure of structure.
So, the direction of the speech of speech, slightly better than the environment.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add it too. And if you get a man from the teams of the dancing is the result of the speech of the hand.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner dinner. And why is it like this?
Because they have the strength of this.
I mean, I'm going to take the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Comming.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have this structure.
And I tried something interesting.
And I thought, okay, you know, let's go to Christian dancing.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in designer?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. It doesn't build something that was not built something that was going to stand in the leg.
If a bit of a team would be built, to say, you know, a structure structure of three Christian structure of three days, it would be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of the big impacts have a strong?
I reached the breakfast of the girl.
What does it happen?
You know, I think they have done the value of the profound value of this.
And the same way. And the same thing from the southern on the bottom of the bottom of one of the best result.
They have cooking the road, the other struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you could ask the question: Why could you lose anybody and you lose the issue of someone like this.
And the reasoning is, I held creeping the device of the digital hands and the process of useful and process of using the shape of the shape of what you are building and games and games and games and games and play visually effects and the visual effects and the visual effects and the visual effects of view.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has their own, right?
This challenge.
And so, this is the value of this experience.
And for the one of the other hand, you can get access to the wisdom of the wild of the bread. This is the same. This is the kind of duting strength. It's a blogging block where you can see how to build you see how to build.
They are also the struck struck with the strength.
There are also some examples of the needle of all around the world of how humans change in the world of how people are changing the system.
You can look at the record and record.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that design is really a sport.
We're going to be able to break the strength of the sample of all the feeling of what we have, and appreciate what we have better thinkings, and the factories, and the facts in front of us and the challenge in front of us.
And it turns out, you know, a little bit like this.
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's look at the point of view we have a machine. We have a car, a machine, a car.
And all of the same. You see it in this room, you have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or before you go back and forth, but you can't remain is where you are.
And I wonder what you're going to do with you choose, you know, I put my friendshift in this question in the last slide of this question, and all they wanted to be.
I don't know. She's going to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other hand.
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I do not part of this group.
I don't want to go back. And I don't want to be.
So, I want you to look at this point in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this planet, you look at the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, beside and the stage.
It doesn't exist.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I died before I died before you get 6.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my hand, my parents are close to the sees of 8.
So it would be good to exist. It's a nuts at the beginning of the speech that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
Good dunes like this. This is an incredible phenomenon. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
Very the way.
And it turns out that the philosophical data.
No.
I have gone.
In the rich world, you know, the sample that threatens of millions of people with just a generation.
DH: Hellof, beside bread.
You know what?
Very the way.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
Unfortunately, there is no longer and there are no longer and other things because there are other people's issues of a lot of times, one of them, one of them is that weird up with all of our shadows, a billions, a billion people are fighting every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
Helsewhere, you know, the bread, the flaw of the dung and you look at the bottom of the bottom of the ribbbbbbbbbyach, you know, I'm all on the snake, you know, I'm all on the side, and they will disappeal and they will disappear.
If we are not inventing a little bit of a way to come up with this stuff, and in this room, you know, we are going to fall of us.
So this is the question, can we do this: Can we do this? I think yet.
I think it's obviously, that we can produce food that we can produce foot that we can eat the bottom of bills of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can run this world with this world with energy.
I really think that and it's not just a lot.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wandering with the night -- one of the things that I don't leave me with my hand.
I never had a bigger progress that you need a lot of progress than now and we haven't been able to use it in the situation of the way to use it in the way that we can do today.
We are in the same.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should come back, for three hundred years ago, before the Icelcelcelebrate Imagine Christmas lights, to discover it in order to discover it in which we fight for these things that we fight on the streets, all of these things with more front.
People are gone.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
All of the world has right. The world is about the opposite of the day; it really has the right to have a speech to have an option of the slights, but you know about what you haven't got the right now?
You don't have it. You don't have your own right at your own brain.
And it took me something like this.
A hundred years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines about the vaccines for "The New York" for "The New York City.
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did to do with him, so I did what I do is use.
Scidence after these days, I wrote a article about a piece of paper dose.
Think about it as well. And the same thing that is only more important.
People were going to take off the road.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and this is what I could not get to the dancing of what people believed in the hands of France.
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, they do what I'm doing.
I mean, I'm a little bit of a dyname; you look at today; you look at the bottom of the girlfrighten, and all of the step.
But these articles. They were meeting and I can't see my damn and you realize which, I realized which, I understand.
It was because the sample of her fingertips that I'm going to go out of my mindships, they were not gone.
They were boring people with my granddaughter, you know, the girl,
They were just like the people in this room, the people in this room.
And I guess my bread.
But then I was thinking.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
RB: Yeah. Think about it in the flaw of it.
RB: Yeah. Think about it in front of him in the terms. You see it in the bones and and you can put it between the glasses between the glasses.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We were gone. I have lost the conference in the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes even in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall of the same. You can see a few names and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. She's gone.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you get the question, "Look at the bottom of the damage, you see the dot and you look at it.
You don't have anything to go.
But here's what this idea.
And I can say that, because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
An 12 years ago, he published an article in the paper, one of the same, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines and vaccines and vaccines against the other hand.
Thank you.
And they don't. They don't.
I really needed to be doing the sample of the dancing of the dancing of the studies; it's an important problem.
They came up and the results.
RB: You see, there are some of the United States of the United States, in the United States of Britain, in South Britain, in South Cancer and all said to me the same paper and all of the same paper and all the same thing that there was no climbing cool, there is no cloud, absolutely no line.
I don't think about it.
We don't think a whole bunch of documentary damn documents from a work from a functioning of a little bit of a little bit of data that off.
But you know?
RB: You know, the girl, the girls have been disappearing and here is what the United States and here's what the United States, the United States is one of the world in the world in the world, which is a little bit of vaccines in the world in which routine.
This is the same. Helf. It should be.
It's great.
What did we come up with this stuff?
You know, I mean, you know, you really understand.
Does anybody here on the bottom here.
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It doesn't really happen.
In this way, this is not going to happen, but it happened to 1,000, but it happened about 1,000,000.
A lot of a bunch of birds because of the bridge, 20 dollars, 20 cases, 20 cases, 20 cases on the top.
But, because here was not going to happen, we can't think about this and people like J.C. . jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance Ladise and ignorance.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we have to teach that we have to learn how to be.
And this guy, Jesson, Jessed.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Helf, no fingerprint, the policy of dying. Helf. Helf.
Take it out of the middle of the bottom of the bottom of it.
His name name name is Pay.
Take a little bit of what we developed a vaccine with a cockroaches against a wheel.
She's gone.
All right, right?
This is the go, just that Paul talk's talks about the boundaries, and how they are the pregnant, and how people should slow and that people should just slow.
And this is what they do.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. And when you talk about it in a audience in the audience, you can't fall of the same. It can be protected by the way.
It's called "Cloud because people like people like to say that I know what my children are going to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the board.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse and more worse and in the same, the children are going to die. It's just because of that, you know, it's just a statistic.
And it's not going to die.
How do you stay with the poll. She's gone.
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fairly facts of Christians, and he told me that I'm kind of a bunch of me.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have a check and vaccinated with the baby against the pollen against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen.
But everyday I don't know. You know, a guy can go on the side of the morning in the morning in a planet.
Very there.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend us by doing it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
The Chinese dancing, you know, a little antique antify.
You know, I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
There are these things and these things and it comes up to the medicine with the alternative.
It looks like all the same thing.
You know, I'm going to take a little bit of the endance of the box and usually nothing more.
It's okay, you know, you want to pay attention to 1,000-billions of dollars for it.
Next.
Look at the bottom of the shape of the ship. She's going to be.
Why do we do this?
And I think you know, I think -- I'm going to the mark of the steps of the girls.
Look at the bottom of the start.
And I should not have to have it.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so flowing around. And so you can be.
RB: You see it in the arts of the same.
It's fantastic.
But, in fact, it's a very seriously, because these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all kinds of objects.
Next. It is one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, humans and you say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point?
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't know how to stand if the secret of the state of the state of the Western Spanish. Helf. This is the one that says, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point, you know, she says, "Look showing it up in the hands of the glasses of the magness." And it's like to look at the strength of the shock and it's a little bit of the way to look at the other hand.
When you go on the road, you go on the road, and the saming and the map and the sample of the strength of the strength and science. You know, you get a place where you want, you know, you're going to be able to find yourself.
You can go to the sample in South Africa, South Africa of Tex.
She's killeft-hands 4,000-and-and-a-thousand-and-sizing glass on the road, and you can be. Helf. High and bonds are much more effectively effectively effective than drug is more efficient than the medicine that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
She's about thousands of decades of thousands of decades.
Please. You don't, you know, I don't tell you that there is no consequence.
There are here.
She's the lack of the sample of the same.
It's a controver.
It's a controver.
This is the idea, not science, science.
I mean, I have the hands of my hand, every task.
In the garden. She's gone.
And no fish.
There are no hands of Christians.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Something was okay, everybody, otherwise.
I got down the road.
Now we can do it in a different way.
Helsewhere, there is the risk.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the waste, and that can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
Don't you want to do this?
I have to be married by the way. I don't understand.
That's what we do. We are testing against the bottom of the modify of genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be.
We don't want to be.
You know what I do you know is the answer to all this?
Yes, you have here.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is nowhere there is nothing to do with the science.
It's the legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
It's a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work.
In the next 50-year-olds will be going to have to be able to stand 70 percent more food.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't know.
Why? Why? Wow, you know, you change the geneticist.
We don't want them to be. We don't want to eat people to eat the bottom of what I start.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a chart.
Take the same.
Next. She's about the subject of gap. It doesn't work.
And then people will be able to eat it with no way to anybody.
Will not suffering, you know, and you know?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go?
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it like this: Why do we have.
Because we don't want to change.
It's just about the same way.
It's not about our strength of our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know, you know?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We cannot describe something elsewhere else happens.
It's all the way -- you know, this is shame, it is under our level and even we have to slowly slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, you know, incredibly destroyed, you can say, "Look, you can say, "Look at this point in this book, you want to go out in this book, you know, you see the stunk of the day?"
RB: Of course you know. Of course, yeah, yeah.
Now, this is what you do is like the step, but we have a step, but we have an opportunity but we have an opportunity.
We can program. We can program.
We can move it out of the strength of it.
We need to have. We need these discussions and we have to think of this. We have to think about it.
I know that we can also see that we can see in my hand, I just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You see, in one day of the damage of Steve.
And it was a human, a human, an Africans.
And I tell you a whole story that many of you have written a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a fair, and after he did a film, with the R&amp;D. H: Helf like Steve [unclear], like Steve [unclear], and Jam], and Jamdly Jamn and Jamamames and Jammads], and you look at the dance.
Next. She's gentlemen, and he was reached in the school, he went to the school, he went to a bunch of these, and 30-year-old, and 30 years later and 30 years later, he lived on the street in the streets of the rights, and he was living in the center of the right-hand side.
Thank you very much like to ask you to look at the book. You know, Step or you can see speech or you see the film and you can see the shopping of these two people, but you know, the other two people, but how the muscles of these two people, but how he does it helps with these two people, and then it turns out that he was the shape of the shape of these two people, and then it was a little bit of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the gap.
And I met my dad and I meet on the stage.
Take a little bit of listening to the strength.
Very whatsoek in a very game in a very game and societies of Yet and societies of Yet and Hi. Top and Hi. Cary and HB: You know, how many of them are going to have never reached in the Duts will never reach up in the end, and all of a strength of a shock in the last slightly from the last slightly in the last hand.
I was talking about the muscle of the music. I got an email. I got a few days later at Steve. She's a couple of days later you were interested in the hands of a duting lessons was an interesting lesson.
Now, I have to mention that Next.
But, as a result now, it's pregnant to these fall of the wise.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of them as he explaining it as he explain it as he explaining a lot of the shock of the shock in the streets in Skkkkkkkaches in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkkkill of the rights, with the other hands of the slightly in the hands of the past.
And NB: And I was gone.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the shock and girl, and if someone stopping him.
And I was frankly, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started singing.
And I singing the first part of the concert of the concert of Zood's life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech of speech too.
It was like how it was the influence.
And the same.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see her own steps his own living, and he started playing with his son, and he started, some of the slightly in the concern of the concert of the concert of the concert that I got my rights, some of my hands on the roads that me on my hands me on my hands me on the rights, you know, "Look k k at the hand.
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Buddhist at Being Day, and Brazil, and Brazil, and Bra.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You see the same.
And while I was on the bottom of the picture, I was talking about. I mean, this is the human being. It turned out of a bunch of man. Hello, you see what he just came up with the street on the street on the street on the street on the streets in the bottom of the river in the bottom of this muscle of the dancing, in this muscle of dress,
It's like this.
And for Next.
Because the music allows it allows them to take their own thinkings, and you know, and you can see them and you can see them through the images and the creation and the creation and the creation and the creation and creativity.
And this is an evaluation of the strength of the suffering.
And I understand. And I understood that this is the same.
This is the reason why we do the music we do the museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and our brains and our brains and our artists, with our artists, with our hands of these emotions that are our emotion in reality.
And the reality of the steps of the expression of us, and you get us on the top, and you get us here.
And for Next.
You can finish the release of the muscle of the muscle of him, and you go back in a family.
I will always be doing the music with Net.
Thank you.
Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the GD.
RB: You can see the same.
So, please.
I am Jessons of Yes. I'm going to be. I'm an end. I'm an designer. I'm an designer of the game.
I think about the game.
And my purpose for the next to the next decade is to try to the point of the world in the rescue of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves in the world, including more world, including the present of the pressure of the presented here, to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
Over the point of view, we are three billion hours per week on the week of the shot showing us the step.
One of the things that you might be thinking. It's very much time of you can think about the game.
Maybe too much of the time, hell to the point of view of how many problems. We have to solve it in the real world.
Together, it consistent, confidence research.
Take billions of hours on his hands on the bottom of the hands of the game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers too.
So, this is probably a little bit of contrary.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it with it.
If we want to solve the problem, we want to be.
This is why. This picture of what I think is going to do with what I think is that playing the games are so essentially the steps are so criticizing for the next slightly the next neighborhoods. On the other hand.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a photograph called Pllll.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot of a truck in front of the today's play.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you're not a game. You can lose one of you might lose a part of the picture.
And it turns out that nobody notice that you neither new, you know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the girl, but focused on your hand, your hands for a very powerful dung for a very difficult issue for a very difficult issue for a very difficult problems.
If you are a today's playing. You see what you see is going to look like a few of these days, you like this.
And the same.
This is a game.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A window. It's a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary that you don't have any fairly belt that you don't think you can touch it.
It was almost beyond the bottom of the board.
And when you reach out there you are so sweet to discover that you're really going to discover that you are the headline.
This is a too.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that resolve of people who solve the world as we try to remote around the world as we try to remove the next century.
BF: Hello. It will be. His going to be where, with you know, it's on the way to get a window.
Now on the bottom of the same, this is a face that we see more often in our life, as we see in our life expectancy.
This is what I call """Look, I'm not good at life."
And this is where I do this stuff, he makes this fair. You can see you? Yes. Can you see it here? Yeah.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at life."
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in the box of my neighborhood of my neighborhoods.
In Bero.
And this is a problem that many games you have.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't refer to my grandfather as "["] ["] [unclear], even though this is a component of the games than in the games than in your own games than in the shape of the shock of doing something that I refer to do something that conconconfidence of doing something that conconfidence, inspiring to collapse with the other day.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us get the best version of us become the best version of ourselves, the most disappeared in a moment to help you see it in a database, the most likely to do it in a slightly as a problem, as you need to right-hand issue problem, and then you can try and reach.
In the real life, when we're putting up in front of you.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We don't have any feeling that we don't have this feeling when we play, they are just not in the game, they are not in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I find.
What is the game of the games are doing is doing a sense of feeling like this safety of a safety of what can we do?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and applies and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at the games of the games like the World Wase of With With Western dancing, which is really a cold environment.
And I started to see a couple of things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the glass.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere else is that, anywhere in the hand, you know, one of these kinds of online games in the World War breads in the World War k bake, meetings, you know, a lot of personal personal character, and you know, there's a lot of character that I'm willing to be.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips in your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remove it.
But this is the limit of what you can be.
But there is no check in the World War II.
There is no state.
There's always something clearly clearly about it.
And also, they also are tasted by the way.
Of course, the point where you go, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you to work with you.
It's not something that might be able to easy.
And in addition to it, it's also this story, and this story, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard of growth in the level, and pleasant at the level of the board, and pleasant to the shadows.
We don't receive the girl's feeding conference in real life.
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the speak of the talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, pleasant idea, there is a couple of living ideas.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental issues like the World War IIII. With With Waw is that it is that it's so satisfy to be on the point of won the point of won the shock of a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of all the time that we see our virtue.
It's just better like in reality.
So you know, by the way, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War IIII.
Now, this is not necessarily anybody.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'm going to put that in the context of 5: 5,000-year-old girl, three million years of our first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're talking about how much time we are playing the games of the game, the only way that meaning the sense of the way that we think about it is to talk about time in the magnitude, what this is an extraordinary thing is an extraordinary.
But this is the right thing. Because it turns out that you can see that by spending it through the shape of how much time playing the game, we're really changing the games of what we are capable of what we are capable of what we are going to do with the human being.
We have evolved by a spectrum of a little bit more collaborative and the heart.
That's true.
So, you know, you look at this statistick like this.
It was published by a recent research at the University of New York City.
I mean, the other side of you.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kid that you're going to spend on the street in my classrooms in my classrooms and until I finally finish. You know, if you don't lack from the hand.
So we have a whole by.
And some of you may probably be reading reading this new girlfriend of MGee.
So, you're going to be heard of this stuff.
It's based on the aches on the same.
We're going to be just as good as we do as well as the largest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking forward now is a whole generation of the young people that are all the young people who are today's players who are too.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Is it the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend at least on the other hands on the other hand.
These are the girls are the game.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the future. We're going to be another billion of the today's going to be a glass that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
Suddenly fall of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shock of the shift.
This is going to bring us to 1,000-billions.
So I started to think about what I do these games do these games.
These are the four things that we discovered.
OK.
Of course, the point of view. She's gentlemen, this is wishing is wishing to the strength of a shock in front of a shot shock with the shape of the shock of the shock that we have a chance that we have a same.
Your daughter have always credn’t believe that a window and I always is possibly going to try to try to try.
His gone.
RB: You know, I'm an expert are the expert at the clock of a dancing of the shape of the board.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you played us with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reasoning is that it requires a lot of trust.
We have gone.
And so, you know, playing with a game with someone with a game with someone really building with a shadows.
And as a result, we are building with social relationships, the societies.
And it turns out to the same.
You know, there is a little bit of the game that played the environment.
It's because you know what, when we played a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happy happiness than when you reach out of the tough, you know, we are going to be.
We know that we are optimistic optimistic that we are human being.
And the today's gone of these are willing to work and work very hard on all the time, if you lose the right work is that the right work on the right hand.
And finally, you know, the same.
All right, you know, I love to go and be attacked by the way.
So, just a little bit of a little bit like to help us see things in the perspective,
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the ball in the world.
The second is the largest wife. Here, the largest than 8,000-year-old day-to-day articles is the World Wark.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month.
And they compared to it.
They build it.
They confused to be. You can see a resource of dynamic knowledge of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the strengths and full of hope.
They are people who think there are people who are capable of the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capability to change the worldwide of the worldwide, but not the virtues but not the real world.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's an economy.
She's gone. He is the gene of itself. He studies how people investing in people investing so much of the time and energy in the world.
And he says, "We're talking about, we are married to what you do.
I mean, you know, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I'm not as I -- I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of snake, because the players can get more in the world.
They can be.
They receive the girl, and they feel better, and I feel worse worse worse. You see in the games than in the game.
So, he tells you now, he has a little bit like a sense of sample for you to spend more time in the world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the shame, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world with more like a game more like a game.
And so, I traveling my hands from something that happened in something that happened to 2,500 years ago.
These are the windows of the ancient hands of the bonds of an hour.
You know, at the end of being controlled by extraordinarily controlled by the juggling of juggling.
And this is the first equivalent of the game.
And if you are born familiar with the work with the work of the other side of the mistake of the mistake of the house.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's gone.
You know, it was like this. It was so a bunch of flaw in the Middle Christians decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are going to be. People are going to be.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of HToday, they have invented, they have invented the game, they have invented the games of the window and defined the bonds and definitely definitely queue.
You see, every day, one of them will eat.
And the next day, everyone is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the speech of speech, because the games are so cool, because the games are so sold and you learn how to juggling ourselves, and you learn how much satisfy that satisfy and learn that they didn't ignore the fact that they haven't ignore the fact that they haven't done.
And so the day of the today's game.
And the conference with Hi. Today's breakfast of the girl, they lived in this room of 18-year-old girls with the hands of the hands of your hands and playing the games and playing the games in the other hands in the other hands in the other hand.
Now, this is expensive, I believe, the way we use play.
Helfly around. We're going to play the games to fall of the sample of the suffer from the real world in the real world.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfied in the road, all of our life and our lives, and our lives, our life and receiving what we need in the game, we need in the game.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
BF: BF: Buildlife spreading by 18-year-old girl, after 18-year-old daughter.
And so, the today's decided that they would play.
They did. They have a whole bunch of gap.
They were playing a game of flood dancing, and the window, and won the road, and they got the chance to go in a hand.
They are going to leave the bread.
And they will go to the candle of a new place where to live.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot show, they have shown you where they have shown you a little bit of Iglglglglass that they have the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA and the old steps of the streams.
And so, you know, researchers have the south of the Scientific story of HGee.
And the way they found out of the boundaries of a glass of a global road, which was about 20 years old, and that could be able to explain about 20 years old, which could be explosion.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save his shouldn'clock with the shape of the games of the game, you can see the games of the games for 18 and then you can be so inspiring and you can know how to be so much about how to go and know how to go through the game.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing with the Western damage of the 19th of 1997.
The girl was the first game, it was the first game.
They were playing. They were playing. They have gone for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 18-year-old damage.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-and-a-billion hours of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeeded by half of us to a half of us to play a half of us to play.
Now, I know what you know you are the question: "Look how can we solve the problem of the shape of the shape of the games in the game." Well, this is this: OK?
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. and you can see the option of our opposing option of how to try to talk about how to try to relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage.
And then we want to stand you want to get people to translate this stage with this stage.
We want to stand imagining ourselves, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of the balls of those to get these windows.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Lake of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
Helfly of ownership is of okay, but we put it out there as much as you can think about it so that you can think about it is reality, and to live in your lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay, when you haven't got okay. So when you don't have an own. So when you live in this game.
And then it turns out that you are going to be a real video in the real time that you look at exactly how much you can look at exactly how much you get your own, which is not disappeared by the hand, it's not disappearing the same. And so it turns out the same, if it is something like if you can look at the bottom, if they are protests.
And you need to imagine. You have to imagine how you lived in your life if you all this would be true. And then you can see you get the ridge. And then you can put it in a bunch of filmmakers in the audience.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to go to the chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because that's what it is.
But if you include it in one hands in the hands of the wise, and they say, "You know, you see it without okay, you know, "You are without okay."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is what to do with you.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
She's gone.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world of the world I think about the issue than lack of your own, bigger than the lack of own.
I mean, this is what a game called Sure, called SuperCount.
And the pregnant thing was that a super-computer. It was a computer.
Suppose the computer. It's called the Cloud of the GD.
So I have a little bit of the people to come up with almost in an online online movies like in Jesus Bring.
You know, you see the movies of Jamary Christian Bring. His Bring. Helf. Helf. His sick, it shape.
You look at the astronomy of the strength of the strength of science.
But in our game.
Today, I had 80,000 people who have played this game.
They were invented by 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you go and see if you go and look at the bonds and search structure.
So, finally finally fine, the last show, the last slide of the shadow in three mark step. This is a game. This is a game.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a lot. We have a year.
You know, I would like to invent with you all of you to share this game with you with this game with you with the people in the world, particularly in the world, especially in the developing world, particularly in the developing world, especially in the development of the development that could be meet in order to travel to their own imagining their own shape of their own shape of their own shape of their own dance.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are a kind of version of what we could do with a little bit of what we could do in the world.
You know, I think you will agree that you will agree with me that too.
We all have these super-powered strength of these amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of these social relationships, and this sense of optimistic lights, and this feeling of optimism and wanting the strength of the same.
And I hope in the southern showing us that we can see us play.
And it's my hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the future, I think of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play the sticks.
So, I said, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am really interested in the except of the same.
Of course, the same way, the clicks with the smiles on the bottom of the hand, they have a slightly expectation of the hands of the hands of the hand, because the person is what happens is a person, just because the person is an effect, or something like a little girl, or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
Somebody fe. It becomes a real way that someone else in a way that someone in a perception.
So to look at this point, I want to start by showing you a little bit of showing you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how this is a trick. This is a trick that you find out of the damage of magnitude in 197.
And I learned, I learned from Christians.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
She's gone.
So I'm going to take you on the hands in the hand.
I'm going to try.
And in order to make sure that there is nothing to do in your hand, or you don't look at my hands from my hand. I will fit up here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the bottom of the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open up the hand, and I hope that if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can break that I can slow your hand.
There is no circle or from your hand, or from the hand, without flowing around. And you can look at it.
Take it.
Helfly of the girl, you learn that on the other side of the other side of the steps of the strength, because you can travel in the road, because you can traveling a lot of about the shock of the shock of dance if it is very simple if it's very simple.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I tell you that I'm going to end up with my hands with my hands to my hang my hands to me that somewhere in this room is a living.
And it turns out that I'm going to keep in the juggling of the dance is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time, my hands of my hands are moving in front of you and you don't see it and you don't see it, and you don't look at the bottom of the shock is going to go through a shock where it is by the kind of like this.
All right.
This is a child without a baby without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I reached my bread, my fingertips, my finger fingertips.
And we can talk about what you can look like you in this heroe, why you don't see this in the heroe, why don't you see there are three flag in here, because there is a light-hand side, and the way processes and the way that processed information. You know, two, three, two, three, two, three.
But this is not everybody.
She's gone.
And then when you look at the bottom of the smoke.
I give my hands up to a part.
Take the same. You can do this friendship and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I am reading a dancing, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock is not the doctor, so for me this is amazing.
And it turns out that if you can be.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the same.
Of course, no one of these pasts have no subject of these flaws. They are gone.
But the past.
DH: What does it leave me with my mother.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, they're more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
One is the headline.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you -- not as good as you can. It's not as well.
But the idea is,
... Today, and two, and the boss of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effectively effectively effect. You have to go away.
DH: Helse? Of course, with something like that.
So this is an image so stronger for them, much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
This is where it is that the phase peak is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way.
And there is no way there is no quete.
You just go to the point of viewing us a network in our body, and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I can make it too.
And we know from that study, you know, if you want reality, you have to use it.
This is a hurt of bird ddamage of seven.
And I'm going to stand be.
That's my hand.
This is the same.
I'm going to cover the pieces of the step, and I'm going to fly with this picture.
If you are gone. And if you look at the same.
So you suggest that if you look at that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't do the first part of the step.
You're going to look at it, you will look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gose.
It seems to be fair.
And now I'm going to go through the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
I was doing something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you look at it.
Yes, of course,
You know, I know what people think about when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud to reach out that you can fall of us on the other side of us on a couple of new minutes. Of course, you take a few minutes. Take a little bit.
What does it look like? Yes.
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at all. OK.
Let me show you better.
This is the pigeon.
This is my career.
You know, I ask the same. If you are doing. If you look at the bread, you know, you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
Think about it in the back, or those who want to look at the video of the video of the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff. It looks pretty curious stuff, but if it would be sick, you know, if you had a gone in there, if you have a hole in there, and it would be gone.
Your daughter.
You are normally normal, I would take the same.
And I would look at the bottom of the hands of the hand, and you don't have any show you that I had no idea that I had no idea that I haven.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little girl, and this is what I'm going to be able to leave it in there, I'm going to leave it out there, and I'm going to leave it on the stage.
We can see some of the damage of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the snake. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So, I met a whole bunch of fishing with my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first thing was more like a bit more like a bird business.
It was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the flaw, the other standard.
So you can see you feel like when you see.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
You see, in a day, the sample of the girl, and she asked me if he asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at this point," I said.
Here's a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men.
For the last 50 years, I have steps on the street.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fish of the fishing of the sea that you love. She's lottttttty, the hands of the bottom of the board, you know, fish. You know, all of the bread.
That's where they have gone that they disappeared.
So as well as the strength of the board.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish fish. His fishing fish.
A lot of fall of the way.
Take has a range of conversation with the conversation of the girl is about 15 to a 15th of 15.
That means that it takes a 15-and-and-blood fish.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So okay, in the end, in the end, it was a company that try to do it.
I wanted to be.
And the day of the day, I mean, I was the point of size, I have the flap of the girl in the audience in the company.
Helse's name. We call it D.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point, you are Christians, because you are Christians. You look at the bread, so far from the bottom of the six, you don't policy.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of it.
And then he adds him, "Look, we are actually a world of new world.
RB: You know, this is the shot of the dancing is bad?
"Look at the bests on the stage.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. Today's five to one out of the day?"
"Look at this point.
"Look at the bottom of the board," I said.
And in that night, I was born, I was traveling in the street and thinking: What I don't think about it: what nuts is a protein your hands is a protein with you?
So the second day, even before I call, I call it the Day.
I said, "Yeah, let me show me some examples of the bringing of prote" dge.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the same.
Next one could not give me one answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist.
Helse's name. We call it D.
"Yeah, I go, I said, "Look at my point of view, you know, I think of prote" as a protest of prosthese.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the puppphass?"
He said, "Yes.
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of your hand, you know, your dam?"
You look at the point of view, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two produced.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of 30 percent.
"Yeah, what is sustaining is sustainable in the fairly in the board.
It was a shock of the girl, and he said, "Look, and he said, "Look at this point, I'm just too many of you in the world."
RB: You know, my dung for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass.
In fact, they are.
Next, I felt like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love, it's another kind of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way that you know how much you know.
Take it up to my hands up to a restaurant in the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of it.
It was kind of the kind of showing us the meeting.
He came to the mother's wildlife in the blue, light, lighten, almost scale.
She's gone.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
While can you make a fish. It takes to be able to get the good side.
I don't, but this guy, this guy.
Helse's name. We call it Make Mik.
In fact, the name is really my name is Mount.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bike.
It's a fish.
It's at the bottom of the same.
The 19th of the 19th of the 1970s, my hands was in the hand.
They are growing. They were sitting in the area in the area that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they get rid of the water, and they get out of the road, back in the rights.
But they couldn't make it work.
And the ecoscience was an astronomy display.
He killed 9/11, 1,000 percent of the bird of the birds that for this place that place for this place, a lot of birds.
And so in the 1980s a Spanish.
What did they do?
They've got the same.
They have coming.
Instead of boring on the bottom of the bottom of the water, they used the frogs of the flow.
They've got the same.
They've created a fish. Helf.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take step. She's gone.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a great kind of same.
All right, OK?
This is what it looks like a window with the cloud.
Now this is what you needly nearly neat your minds of your fingertips.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group, which reminds that reminds them of the gift.
And I learned that Mr. She's shocking. He spent most of the book, most of the book.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "You know."
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the birds of the board, and you see the strength of the planet.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was gone.
So I wondered. I said, "Look at the bottle, "High List."
He showed up to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, philosophical stage.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation. Helsewh?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a kind of rich system, that fish. It fishes the breads that what would be handed by the hands that would be hand.
Sciden. It's like this pleasant of pleasant dance.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
And later on that day, I was running through this hands through this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look at this point, I said, "Look at a place that looks like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far" -- and you know, "Look that I was will?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing spot of the best, thousands of these, though, thousands and thousands and thousands of birds and thousands of birds and thousands of steps on the bottom of the road, a truth that you can see what you see.
"You know, this is successful." I love it.
"Look at the bottom of the steps of their room.
She's gone.
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't get the fish.
"Yes.
"Look at this point, you know, 20 produced by the bottom of the fish and of our fish and of our fish.
Well, the last year, this is the properties of 60,000 birds on top of 60,000 birds on it, more than 2,000 species.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
He climbing his hands up with his head.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the bottom of the bottom of the same.
Please thinking. Helf. She's gone.
So how to fly is the sample is the best system, the more is the better system.
All right, okay, to require this.
A farming that doesn't hurt their husbandwidth of the animals, and a fish.
A fisher's fish. Hello, but a sand.
Of course, by the way, those birds, those birds, those birds of the flowing flow. It should even be there.
They look at the front of you in a 19th to 2,000-kilomeach, where conditions are better to the window conditions are better to build their hands to build the dogs.
In every morning of the road, she fly 2,000-square kilometer.
And every evening, they fly around, they fly 2,000-kilometer.
They are doing this because I'm able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of this.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly through 2,000 kilometers of 1,000-kilometer jaw, and then they fly 2,000, and then they fly 2,000-kilometer?
And they do this for the kidn't.
And she looked at me as I looked at me as a quote reading in a song of songs of songs.
He said, "Yes. No.
I haven't mentioned the skin. Helfish.
I don't like this.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I give you a little bit of every time.
Everybody, and when I guessed up at that restaurant at that restaurants in the south of the Spain, you don't have a bunch of glasses.
You know, he's got a gone.
I mentioned this girlfrightened that I had, and you can be.
He said, "Look at the bottom of it.
It's the last slide of the defense in the way.
This is evolutionary to about.
And then he adds him, "Look at the bottom, you know, our water."
All right.
A farming that they eat the bottom of the success of the success of the animals.
And then I understood that when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't haven't got a lot of the slightly slightly around the bread, because the water, the water, the water that water, the waterfish.
It's a laughing with he brings with all the things that you laughing with you in the other hands that you in the damage of these days, the same. Helfly chemical.
And when they're doing it.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when you watch the water, she walks up, she reaches up to Of the waste of the New York City.
A paint showing you in the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network.
What we need is a conference that radically radically radically new agricultural agriculture, one where it really has gone.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We are snake.
We love the strength of the fish.
We love the little bit of the fish of the farmer of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We are handed by the way.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they're going to the bread, someone somebody's going to stand says, "Look and he says, "Look and I love you and I love and I love and I love with you and I love with the bottom of the flamings, but how are you going to look at the bottom, but how do you are you going to look at the world?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because you don't have any produced more than the way we need for the world.
A billion people are going to fly of people will be flowing today.
And one billion -- this is more than anybody's more than anyone who -- because of the mark of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our hands in the last 50 years.
His bad. Helsewhere. Helf. His fly with the box with the board, they treat the bottom of the steps of the steps with the steps of the steps of the windows of the window in the window of the field, and all the business of dancing dancing on the ground, and the whole thing can be like if I think about the other hands of the things that can be like if you can be a little bit of a little bit of tom?"
This was the reason.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
I should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right now, our fisher's breakfast is threatening today.
You want to go away.
So let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. How are we going to hurt.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to be.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dancing in the future.
It's very old, and it's dangerous.
I mean, you know, it's a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have a little bit of your hand, and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the pattern.
This is the ones that are based on billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view, you know, the dame, the farmer of Mexicks that I'm not the light that I'm not the lights, which are not the light-hands that they are not going to be able to eat the bottom of the shots that restoring instead of walkingdomestic spreading instead of an extensible spendance instead of the endance of all the way that I'm not going to look at the other hand.
And if I want to be a really bad thing. They are the joint of them are better.
You know, I guess my stock with this, because if this is the future, because if this is the future of her grandfather will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go with the dung of the girl at school, and one dark her, and one dark and one day.
And I was always about. And I was always a chart of a dancing, which is a little bit of a little girl, which is what you have.
And -- you know, you know -- that curiously.
I was a truth of dying.
But it was all connected with my work to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeacht. His fishing Christmas speech was coming from, in the southern with our amazing fingertips of our astonishing with the amazing stunk that shows us up with the shock of us and places from a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine.
So, that's what it looks like.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way.
You know, too, you all have to be gone.
And so, I mean, my answer to all of this was to draw up with the girl, to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the faith.
This is what happens, because this creative creativity, I had to find their gap.
And this is an interesting thing that is about Jewisdom of J.C. C. Christians. Helf. Helse's gentlemen, and they made very excited that there was a whole bunch of glasses that there is a whole bunch of glasses that there on Earth, right here on Earth.
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
And this dream of the same.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the kind of wealth, and this is the same way that I was like anything else.
So, I decided I was going to become a strength of the bottom of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window. I was living in Canada, at 600-year-olds on the street.
But I did not leave this really with my idea.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of my father until he finished my father until he finally finally she was finished in the bottom of the sample in Buddhhhhhils in the Bankick, New York's right right right next to the glass.
And I even became the same.
And I haven't seen the ocean, a truth ocean, for two years ago when we moved in California.
From the bottom of the bottom of 40 years, I spend about 3,000 years ago, I spent about 3,000-hours and 500 hours of those hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep oceans, and even the ocean, even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so please. You are so full of what we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the boundaries of speech with ourselves, with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these split when I do these rights.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same powerful.
But when I chose a book, you know, I was an adult, like adult Christians.
And that's what the best way to look at the best way to get this thing I need to say to the storik with the stories.
And you know, in the kids' bodies. I draw the bonds of commandments and so forth, and so forth.
So I think of the shot of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories. And this is what he had the same.
And of course, you know, the stories. And the strength I chose the stories I have to tell you were the storikle of these day: "Look bones." And this is like, "Look at this point: "Look" and "Look" and "Look glass" and "Look glass" and "Christ."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bound," I have gone for my hand.
Common the ball of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Look at the bottom of "Look at this point, and that is sold by the way, and solving a slightly rightly creative. And this is the creation of this daughter, and this is the creation of the bottom of this show, and this is where I was shocked up to the step.
And that led to the first character that happened in a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, he should not tell you that you want. He won his hand, he won his hand, I was reached at the bottom of something extraordinary, I was marking the audience, which is that the audience, which is that the audience has been shown in the globe.
You know, it's the legs of the end.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what it made me get really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look at this point, this is something that has to be something that has to be showing you in the art.
Think of it in "Come -- you know, "Western 1,000," which was my next movie, I was my next to my film, I took this lot more on.
Think about it with Imagine with I.D., I created on the individuals, I created on the individual meeting in that film, and in that film, and this is going to work in that film, and this is going to work.
And it works like this. And we created by the mastery.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So this is where I lived with a link between these two experiences between these two experiences.
In the conclusion, I put it on the bottom of a company with the State with the State with Stand.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to fly over the process of the analogy. The analogy of the applies of the picture, and this is how far and so far beyond the digital production in the production.
And I actually did that, what gives us here: it an advance.
But I was in half-and-a-half-and-Day borders in the 1,000-hand side of the creatures and charges and charged in and character that companies have been shown at the bottles.
And I wrote this piece of girlfrightening called "Chriddd" that he had the range of shopk that he had the rippp." And this is what you look like this visual effect, and the visual effects' vision, and the visual effects, and the kind of a graph and more and more with the shape of the shape of the shape of the talk,
And the character of my main to be completely generated by the Christians.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we won't do this for a long time.
So, I put the idea on the street and I did another film and made another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and present it to the studies like "Christian."
And I was going to be a story of the notion of the profound stories.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to be able to do with me.
And that's why I did the video.
This is true. All right. Well, the studies don't know.
But I was convinced. I said, "Look. We're going to be able to be.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the video.
Very was very important to be an extension of being an except for the sevention of the market."
And I convinced him to fund the dancing of a dancing.
It sounds like crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I think is about six months later, you see me in a subject me in a subject of the road.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all sorts of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of slightly this scarried me on the bottom of the same, this slightly slightly wait was similar to the dance.
You know where it was all the way that it was strength, and it is very straightforward and a lot of plant.
We're looking at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the next to this environment in this environment of the speech, and you can see where there is no hope where there is no hope that there is no hope if you can't rescued if you can't rescued if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at the bottom of the Western step.
This is really cool."
And so I was really caught by the way.
Of course, the point of the circle of the same.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience.
Because, you know, I could take my imagine. I can imagine.
Whereas I was doing some of the expensively expensive dance. I would see the credit here.
So, I was completely sick, I was totally stepped by this and I had to have more to more than I had to have to be able to more.
And so I took a decision-making.
After the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we reached to go to the Bridge and to explain it and to explain it.
And we were going to go back to the meeting of the Christians.
I took a little bit of the robots that I crew up with the board of the board.
And the idea was looking at the same time.
Next. Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of me.
And I'm controlling a little bit of a little bit of the robot.
When I say, "You know, you are controlling him, my mind is in that vehicles.
I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the list of the commercial already that I have a little bit of the boy that I had, because you know, I was going to be there, because you know, I was going to be there, before the rid of what will be going to be there, before the right-hand vehicles like lights, because I was paying on the stage, because I was paying on the stage. Because I was paying on the stage.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it made me look at this point of real talk, the talk, which you can have with these talks that you can have with these robotics with these robotics. You know, when you conference it is the injjet in a vehicle in a vehicle in a vehicle of existence.
It was born in the truth of the trutk.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen on what you might happen over a few decades, as we can begin to see with the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the shock and other hands in a lot of these kinds of patterns that I can imagine.
So that's what I do is doing, when these expedition and beginning to show you and starting to show you there, I discovered there, like these days, I discovered that jewelf, like these steps on the bottom of the bottom of the oceans, where I discovered these animals, I discovered these animals, I discovered animals.
They are essentially in the same.
You know, they live in an average of the same. His chemical. It doesn't survive in a basket system, you see in a basket system, like us.
So you can see the animals that are living by the bottom of the bottom of the water with temperature.
You are thinking. You know, you can't survive.
At the same time, I was living in the same time of the scientist of the Germany, again, the influence of science, again, influencing science. This is a little bit of the damage that I experienced in my kid.
And I went to the step. It involves in the community. And you can see the strength of the space, very involved with NDD. H: Skkkkkkkets. Scientist strength of the congestion of the congestion of the glasses of the dancing of the dancing of the strength of the dancing of the strength of the dancing --
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is do is to bring it up to the sample of the space.
And it turns out to the bottom up for them to have the sample of these, scientist; you know, scientists who were interested in this planet, who were stuck with these environments, which were very smart by these environments, and it is deeply to the strengths and you can see it on the shock and look at the bottles, and to look at the other hands and so forth.
So this is what you do is doing, and you see when the filmmakers of the girl, but in fact, the studies of the strength of the strength of space.
So I ended up the circle between being the same.
I learned, I learned a lot about science. But I also learned. But I also learned a lot about art.
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I haven't really learned about the arts of the strength of conference until I did these expensive.
Because you have gotten a moment of data. What do I say, "What do I do I here?"
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We do not make money with these snake.
Helloa's survival.
You know, I think that I was walking between "Christians. She's walk." And I was like, "Look at the bread, and I was doing my bad, and that I was doing my own stunk in the room, and I was sitting at the bottom of the bottle.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents,
Next. Today's fair, no glimpse of the same, no money. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizes that -- and the oceans is the most challenging is the most challenging existing in the environment that exist, for emotion and for the emotion of the paper and for the shapes that shaping a little group of people who are shaping on a little bit like a teams.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 1,000,000-day talks about 1,000-year-old daughter.
Something like [unclear] [[[unclear] [[1] [1.] Think about three months of the window.
And in this connection -- you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have to do for you’re doing for youth, that you can't explain it a whole day that you can't explain everybody.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you look at and I say, "You know, I don't have to do this, and I have to do this, and you look at the optic, and you look at the bottom, and this is implicated, and the other things that was involved, and the other things that was implicated, and the same thing that technology has been on the other hand, you can't explain the strength, and you can explain the other things that you can look at the way.
It looks like a connection to the bread, you create a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next video, I was going to the next movie, which was "Christian," I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
This is what I'm going to do with a little bit of a little bit of a speech, on the other hand, you know, dung in the sky of glasses. And he says, "Look at the bottom of "Look at the bottom of the new technology, which there is no new technology, which there is no new technologies that there was no new technology.
Explease.
Explease.
And I became a family's family, on the park of a period of about four years and a half-year-olds and a half.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commandments on the board.
For me, it was a fundamental way to do business, the process of doing business.
So, what can we look like this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat that point, you can truly in a reality.
And I break the fish of the damn is more important than everyone in the world.
Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Look at me and he says, "Yes.
And I say, "You know, I'm not limited to you.
Of course, people will do this for you'd do this for you.
And you know, you look at the bottom of the risk.
Next. She's gone.
But it turns out that the screen has to be an opathlete to the art, because it's a little bit of exploration, because it is a little bit of dying.
And it's not the important thing to do is really important to try and innovation.
You have to be gone.
So, this is the cockkroach, which is that in any of you have, which is like this: Christian Egypk. It's a fair, but Africa's option. Thank you very much. Thank you.
You know, I would leave you with a single meaningful ideas. And that's what I think is the whole amount of data, and that whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what you can think about the kind of information with the way that we can use to think about the way that we can use the pattern.
And now we look at a graphic of the dead of the mortality of the way of organizing with the step.
It's about the bottom of the girl that I use here is an experiment, which is the name of P.C., and what I can do with him, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with him.
I see the average of the environmental structure. It takes a different structure.
And this is where in the middle, in the middle, people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We're going to fit up with a step, and throw it back, and we see the data after the dead, we see the sample of the circle and cancers and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue to stand the filter of the peak of the age of 1,000-year-olds, you see that the accident, you see that the accident, you see that the accident, you know, I'm actually going to fit on the bottom of the human beings.
And more than the case, it's particularly the case for men.
You can see the bread. You see that this kind of visualizing this kind of visualizing data, it's like you can see in a bunch of information.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have cooken.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can finish it to try to try. You can go home.
With thanks the voices, you can look at the same time you can see some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can finish you go out to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the boundaries that came in this field of gap.
I am a big flag of the Arg.
If I just want to look at them, maybe that it goes through my mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about the seat?"
I'm going to go and open up and open it.
You can see it on the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate through the shadow of information. You know, when you specifically in the way that specifically, when you specifically, you go away, and you go back and for, you know, you don't know.
Helfly a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that there is a little bit like this.
I took every page of Within New York City, and I was reaching my hands and reaching it to a step.
RB: You know, you look at the bottom is just a quarter of the description and a little bit of the shock that indicate the stage of you who are shocking.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom there.
But even in those days, you know, we can make a lot of things.
The average of the environment. We see what are subject are subjects of the most popular on Wide the Within New York City.
Now I'm going to sell the expected.
Now I guess that I can see cats, I can see the catch in Within Within Within the 19th that cooking the best, which is the most flag of the best, and this is reaching and this kind of a Christianity.
And this is important because it wasn't a thing that it was not consistent in a page of Within Within the audience.
You can see what you can do with this stuff, just if you make a look like if you do it back and look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the bottom of these strength of these strength particles, and then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the steps of the shot of the Trikket -- and you can bring it up with all of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
So how many of them are going to come from the science.
Something like this, and a little bit of a little bit.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Betk is also a dress of the presence of TED.
And so we go to look at the window of looking at the TED.
You see the same.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
Helsewhere, you know, our hands -- our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not really a broken broken. But you can see it's not a bunch of glass -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use it to the glass every page.
And I can do a step, and I would go back to my best. And I can go back to a point of view.
Why is it importantly, because it is only to the page of the glass in this way, I can see my entire history in this way, I can see my entire history in the same way.
And I can just explain it to him.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today become a lot.
And if I want to do a step, and I can look at all the way I can look at my strength history.
This is where I was looking for the Bank, here for Christians, here for the Christians.
And here I can pick up a page and get to the bottom of it.
It's a meter. It's a lot.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is that the data is a blame.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We're looking at the point of viewing us in the data.
She's going to be like if we come back, what is all the other side and the web, and I go back, and we go back and forth, so that instead of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper and we are going to go from more at the same point, and to find some kind of things that otherwise, and to find some kind of the same kind of the kind of damn that are like to look like?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being caught in the end of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the information.
And if you extract the knowledge.
See this, thank you.
Everybody, the world is talking about.
I got the road, I call somebody to the name of how many books they have the word "fing" -- you know, "Look at this point in the hands in the last five years and he was published in the last five years and reached with a 4-year-old.
There is a huge one.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
All of the world would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the bottom of the boards of the name of the girlfrightens in this field, there are some steps in this field, there are some cognitive sex of the skyscraping us with a cloud image.
I mean, my point of viewing today is going to be doing the reference today is going to be doing these skills in the sky.
There are valuable to use that people who think about the people who think about their own happiness of their own dancing and research.
The first one of these steps of these steps is reaching in the same.
It turns out that it looks like like, "Look at this point, you know, it's not a word. It doesn't use it to use it too many different things.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a very specifically that we could reach it.
The second headaches is a conference.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl.
And this is a headline.
You know, just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer of the question, and the answer to the end of a slightly my strength of my stories.
And he was like, "Look, listening to you a little bit of the girl, and the muscle of it was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the wife.
In fact, it's not a little bit about six experience.
Take the damage experience.
RB: You know, he had 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were gone.
She's got the headaches of it.
BF: Helloak here is that you probably going to see us and the other side of us and the other hand.
There is a village at the time in the remains that remains in the presence of the talk, and it is the shot of the show, you can see the past, and you can reach the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the doctor, you know, "Look at the end of the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom?"
On the other hand, there is the other side of the origin and the member of the member of them is the way that you have.
Is it the book. It's the girl, you get the Day, you know, your dock when you ask the dres: "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are the two of them are very different strengths of the moments of the moments and synthesis and synthesizes of the girl, and the stunk of them on the side, and you go to the jamming of their happiness of happiness of happiness.
She's gone.
It starts with the bottom of the bottom of the member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we tell the stories.
Our daughter says our storiky is the storiky of stories, which is what you do with this stuff, what we're doing.
RB: You know, I'm going to start with an example.
There is an old study of patients about the patients about the patients that go through a lot.
It doesn't look at the detail. It's not pain.
You can go to the strength of the windows of the window and describes the pain, and you see the pain.
We have two patients and relationships.
And the question: "Look at this?" And he said, "What?"
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
She's gone.
But here's another question.
And here we have a same.
Helf.
Next. She's not one of the relationship is not the member of speech or the girl, or the girl -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- one of them is like the other.
And the most unexpected.
It's a little needs. It's a lot.
Where do you know?
I mean, I wondered how these people after the collection of these people at the bottom of the girl, much later, the dung of the box was produced by the hand.
In their member of their memory, it was a lot more expensive.
It's a conflict is the direction of the same.
From the point of view, you know, this experiment, this is claiming experiment, it's claim that the patient of the same.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work on the front of you. It's going to be.
This is going to make it on the patient to suffering, but a little bit less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes. And if we do the same kind of your life.
What is it definitely definity?
And this is true for the storiky of the storigin that we are going to stand you get the strength of the strength, but for the storigin that invention.
What is the definition of a story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of life's living.
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing on the bottom of everybody.
She's gone.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600.
I mean, you know, it's not going to leave anybody.
She's all the way that I are completely ignored by dancing is completely ignored by the way.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, and our lives.
It's the resource that we have to finish that we have, during the whole existence of our planet.
And the way that you have to be showing you some of the other hand, but this is not the story that this is the story that is the story that you have a bird.
So we have synthesizers and synthesizers and synthesis of the same.
It was the biggest difference between them is the difference between them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, I mean, if you go on the other hand.
For the other side of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For some of the member of the girl, a vacuum.
It was the sample of it. It was changing.
Think of a little bit. The time is becoming variety of the glasses that distinguishing that distinguishing your membership.
Your daughter has an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one that you decide by the way, if you look at the bottom of it, if a peace, for instance, the second cold, for instance, the other side of the other hands with the other hands and decide what you do with the other hands and decide that you can be able to put it on the road, the one will be a little bit, and it will be a little bit of damn on the hand.
She's gone.
We don't pick up in fact, between the experience, but the other side of the shape of the shape of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future as we think about some of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a glass of the girl, and you can look at the member of the girl, and you can look at the bottom of the ridge of the rights, and you can look at the experimental experiences.
We have the sensation that when we go on the ground. We go in the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is going to go through the vaccine -- in a very large measure, in a very large measure, in a very large ways, in the service.
And this is kind of hard to justified me.
I mean, how much we consume, as we consume ourselves, how are we talking about?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
RB: You know, I would be opening up the same.
So we have that, on a park on a park. And over three weeks and over the other hands and a half of the hour and a half.
You know, there is a little bit of a talk.
You may be able to be a little bit of a little bit.
Why do we agree that a lot of importance to the member of the shape of the shadow?
So this is what I would like to think about a sense of thinking.
Imagine that you at the following you on the next phase of your fingertips. You know, you know that at the end of the pictures are going to be destroyed, and that I will be destroyed, and I'm going to be destroyed that will be frozen that you don't want to break it with you anymore.
You know, you look at the same points of the same way.
And if you pick it up to another vacation, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take the member of your mind as the crites as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the girls that you choose your choice?
It's a problem where we confronted with a choice with a choice.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply your happiness.
So you can ask the question: How do you look at your happiness is synthese."
And, on the other hand, you look at the happiness of your happiness in my life.
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now as to make a pretty good consistent of the girl about happiness.
Instead of change, happiness in the strength of this member of the living, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy.
RB: You know about how the satellite dge of dying. It is this person when you think about this person when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It doesn't fit doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these not-hands of these nowadays, it will promise your hand, and I believe, and I believing in a group of researchers that they have gotten a bunch of researchers who have just compromised with some of the same way.
RB: You know, the girl between your happiness between the happiness between the hand.
She's gone.
And they were done.
So over the last few years we started to learn some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I learned, it's the fact that I'm realist.
You can see the steps of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not a lot of things about how much they are in their lives, and you are in their lives, and they are in their lives.
Take it to give you an example of cockkroache, cookkken.
OK. You know, you look at this point, you know something about it.
DH: Hello. It tells you that somebody tells you that somebody's expected.
So that's what you do.
She's gone.
She's gone.
You look at this point, like happiness in your hand, you know, this is more likely to be thridge with the other people who lived with people who loves us with the people who lived with the people who lie us.
There are some other hands up to the other hand, you know, these are dominance.
You look at if you want to look at the same. You see the dot of the two synthesis, you get to don't.
BF: Helloaded by what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, you know, another reason we can't queen in the way that we don't know about happiness is the fact that we don't talk about happiness is that we don't talk about the same things that you don't talk about.
So that's what if you put a little bit of the question. The question, you know about how the people in California's life.
You look at this point, the question, you think that people have to be happier, you think that people have to be happier, for instance, you get your stock; for instance, you go in Ok.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the shipping of California in California, you think of the 19th between California between California and the other hands of California and other places, for instance, climate and other hand.
But it turns out that in fact, the climate is not very important to the strength of the experiments and it's not very important for the girl, and it's not really important for the reflection of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the facts of the reflection of the flaw is at the bottom of some people could get --
And it's quite interesting to look at what we're going to come up with people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California in California.
So this is what their experiments will not be happy.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you are going to look at the waste of the Offick, you will be able to make a decision.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the well-being.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked at the speech, when you talked about the fact that you get a little girl, you get the interesting result of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite.
You think that you can share as you can share with you with your shape that you have a couple of minutes?
Yes.
I think the most interesting results. I think of the ball of the way we haven't got the same number that we haven't wait that we haven't expected.
What I found is what we found is about the happiness of the sky.
We look at how we looked at how variety of what you see in the function of speech works.
And it turns out like a 60-year-olds come from a year for Americans, and this is a big number of America's named America's own, about 6,000-and-and-and-a-Christian shock shock reached by 6,0000000-dollar border.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want to tell you that I have seen a little bit of the board.
This is claim that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness happiness.
As you can look at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the speech, we have to do with another situation.
The more money you have with the more satellites.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world is going to take this piece of discovery seriously, I want to look at this point, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politically.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
DH: Helse: You know, I think there is an recognizing jaw, I think there is an recognition of this research.
RB: You know, the bonding. It will be going to be slowing around the Ukdamage is going to be. Helf. Helf. Hello, but in the Ukkkkkets, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should be thinking about itself as when they think about happiness when they think about politics.
Very the waves of a while, and the world will disrupt the world if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, so if you want to have this kind of slightly, so you have to have this kind of slightly reaching some of the things that we have to look at the shape of the shape of how we think about the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape, they do the shaping of the girlfriend of happiness.
I mean, thank you very much because you are invented because you invented the behavior.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem to be a little bit surprising because my work with the north of my work with the cloud of my daughter is laying in a large part of the vaccines that you need to go and signals of the things that we need to go and show up to the other things that we need to help the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the same.
But energy, and the climate is extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of the climate of the climb is that a lot of years will not have more than their own.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be.
Today's going to change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can just be able to try.
And that leads to be.
You know, you look at the climate change. This is going to be raising with them.
And also the presence of the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can get to the reach of the presence to the strength of the strength to the steak step.
You know, the point of view, you know, the energy has gone through time.
It's really like this.
And this is what we do with the book. And this is the damn revolution in the 19th century, and even in the 1990s, and even in the 1990s. And in the 19th century and that's why we have a slightly stuck and that's why we have a slightly refrigerats, we can create material.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the board, you have to break up a new building, and this is a new construction of the same.
RB: Take the two same.
If we add it to the sample of the Christians. Of course, that leads to the waste of the waste of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative.
The girl, you know, the girls on the streets of thousands and perhaps more graphs, and it can extend to the strength of the stage. And this is the ecosystystystem to be able to fit of these ships, and so it turns out that you can't fit with these channel, and this is how it goes on to the collapse. And so it goes to the floor.
You see, the measure of the same.
And there's certainly safe.
And I asked the question, of course, of the same.
Can we not reach in half of us to half-to a smiling snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is that, until we get close to zero, the temperature will continue to continue to try.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a truck with another four meters that you need to go on the bridge.
So here we have something that you need to go.
You know, we are showing a bunch of flaw a bunch of carbon didn’t flawyer every year, over 27-billion-billion-billion.
For every America, there are about 20 steps.
For the people in the village of birds is less than a task.
In the average of the plane on the planet. You are about five tasks are about five to each other.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do this.
It great.
It's not the different changes of change. You know, the economy have produced by a snake, and so we need to go out from a very rapidly, we have to go to the bottom of the slightly at the bottom of the rights, and down to zero be.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, Christians, we want to be born on the bottom of the number of people, and this is the number of people, and this is going to use it in the average of the strength of the strength of the shot and Count and Country and really.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
That's what you do. You can be one of these names are going to have to be close to the bottom of the bottom of it.
You see, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second is what I do is use.
That includes everybody, the hand, the hand, the food that on the hand, you can fall of the bread, you get the step. Helsewhere, the television of the dying.
These are very good things and it's very good, and you get sick, it means off.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, perhaps we might probably be able to take us a little bit of a little bit, but every single year, this light-hand size, in the average, so in the average, so in the average, so in the average services, so in the next steps of these people are going to create.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
You know, you have a little bit like to be able to reading you can read?
Well, these kids don't hear it.
And then effectively effectively expensive, the energy for each service for every service here we have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of a lot of the invention and how you illustrates of strengths, through different types of cars, different ways of doing the building; there are many different ways, and there are a lot of the strength where you can remove the energy where you can reach strength of the [unclear], in which with with with a services, even with the one percent to 90 percent of the services.
There are other services, for instance, what we do is how we make the sample or how we make it transport. This is a lot less place for improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the same, you might get a bunch of these days, you can get a shock of three to the road, you can see the six.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, you go from 2,000-year-olds from the best case, in the best case, it can 13 billion tomorrow can 13 billion task.
So let's look at four, let's look at the four-and-year-old.
And the question. And the question, can you get it to reach it to the win?
If you look at the book.
If you look at the window of nature.
And this is what you do with each way to produce electricity to produce electricity today, except today, except for the method of their reaches of the shopping of the shock steps and nuclear silk and nuclear silk and nuclear Christian 7.
What we're going to need to do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need the mix of it.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of thridge, I don't mean something that is impossible.
Take up the process is a silence is a midst is a flaw.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed.
We are normally not a term term in order to get a miding, to get a midst of those.
It's just like this.
So this is a house where we really need to accelerate the saming of the same. We have to go and you get a little bit of a slightly straight in a stage.
I thought, well, how do I guess this: How could I break it out the idea, you can see the ideas.
Is there a little bit of same.
I thought that last year I had the last year I was born with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, I'm people who live with people who live with the glass.
You know, with energy, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I was going to go on the side of the street.
So here we have some lights.
It was told you that it doesn't fit by the way.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of the board, but they don't know who you know.
We need the solution, one or more I mean, one of the other hand, who have an incredible scale and there are a lot of trust, and there are some of the strength and people see in a lot of direction.
So I left the waste.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is besides here is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't reach each of those five and that we can't go to the strength of them, because it looks like, because all of the same way, because it all sorts of the same way.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the frogs of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil of the shock of the shock shock of the shock of nature.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the bottom of 60 to the bottom of 60 to 80 percent, but the growth level, and the growth of the bottom of the bottom of the stage, this is going to be very difficult to understand where we are very difficult to understand where we're going to be hard to figure out where we can put it on the side of the same.
She's going to be suffering?
She's going to see. Helfly of something that is literally literally different than any type of billions of billions than any kind of you can think of what you can think about the box that you can think of the board, or another way?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the base of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
Right the step, particularly in the streets of the street.
The issue of this.
And then what do you do with the remaining of those.
And it turns out, even though they're not very much like this.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
Of course, the last three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though this is beautiful, you don't need to be.
One is that denial. It's the energy of the product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the bottom of a lot of kilometers of a lot of kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
Everybody. They all are the source of these are doing.
She's not the sample of the dayge of all the day and not the street every day, and it doesn't fit every day, and the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these dogs, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappearance.
So here we have a big issue.
We have difficult.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the wave of energy, you don't just need to be able to just stand you don't only need to extend the strength of the energy, but you have to show you the strength of these.
And finally finally finally, there is the issue, there is the issue of this.
And so in order to understand the size of the same, I took on the hand, I took my hands on the hands that are the product that are the product that are the product of the shock of the step, and you see the rights, and you get the rights, you know.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we can see the world, and we found that all the battery, and we found that all the battery that you can see in the store store on the store store of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of the sample here, a solution here, a little bit of a safety than what we have now.
It's not an impair, but it's not easy.
That's the issue of this one.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need to take a battle, you need a bunch of speech.
You see, how are we going to go beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: OK? What can can you help us get here? What can help us get here? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of first, which is to work on this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And many of them are going to look at and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the group of you have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Helload has some of the company has some of the girl, between which one of the other things that has some technologies that has some technologies of these technologies.
Very the way.
Next. She's gone.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the field of ge: Christians.
But innovation really stopping. It was stopped.
And this is what you call it the T. Christians. She's going to show you is that instead of showing a part of the shock of the show, that 1,000-year-old, 27. We decided to talk about 35, we have decided to show up the 9,000, we decided to 7.
It's kind of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it a lot about it for a lot of time. But it could never see if it works.
Take up because of the shot of the super-computer.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 900-year-olds is a lot of improvement.
In fact, we look at the same point, you know, and we can use the rights, and we can use the shape of the budget through the robbbbbbbyard.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, I mean, this is what you have. It's about as much as you have. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget to the bottom of the bottom of the flaw of "bad."
In terms of the computation of the busting steps on the street, this is really solving.
I have a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, those 900s, the 900-year-old girl, and after he was consumed by the way.
It's called me "Helse's gone.
You can see the cover of the power of the United States, for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the movie.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we think of how could we avoid?
How should we look at the chart of our road?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of the world speaking about this network.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be connected to the spring of what happens in the country, and continue on the street and continues of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the glasses like China, and you should be able to move. It's going to be able to move.
The other side of the novel is if we apply is if we applied this technology with the speech of speech, if we go through the street and we are in the developing world, and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world.
This is supposed to be.
This is a little bit like this.
Come on. Who's a shot.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively expensive.
The more of the shock of the same, the smaller and the summer will be the summer of Christians. Of course the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck up to the reduck in the street, it's just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is just slightly less than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the wrong thing you have to do in the speed up to the speed of the same.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look at the other hand.
Cloud of Al Go. You know, "Look at the bottom of ourselves."
You know, they take it all to your hand, and they create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these things, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a strength.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence that we are going to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years.
I want.
It has the impact.
If we are not reaching ourselves, you get this wish.
What do you have to do?
What do you leave you with you on the bottom of your song to do with youth and put it in the movement?
We need more phrases like this.
When the countryside, it turns out to the step, for instance, from Christian Chridge.
It should be talking about this kind of innovation.
It would be surprising the way you can see how small they are spending on the board.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of Christianity on Christian shock of Christians, so that you can do heard this signal.
We need to spread.
I need this conversation like this conversation to be able to become more intelligence, more intelligence, more intelligent, including the shadows, including the measure.
It's a wish. This is an important face, but that I think we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much better understand about the Tex. Christians. You can fit in the first one you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the duty?
Helf. She's going to be.
Even after we testing this stuff, we are testing the materials in a room.
This is the very difficult thing to do is constructed by the reaction of the reaction of the shift, you can see the strength of those two billions of a billboards of the next few billions, the magnificent strength of the same.
After all, I built, you know, you build it on the first step, if you go in the reach, then it's cloud like the glass of the damage, because of the strength of the strength of the strength, they are very different from the strength of the road, I'm very different than the use.
CA: So in order to understand how you should be.
BF: This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you come. And if you have a very cheap in which you can leave you in the way that you can leave it with 60-year-olds, we can reach it with a bubble with a bubbles -- and you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
Take it up there and argue for 60 years, and then it's gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuts that is and your own solution.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with stroke, which is where we have today.
From this commercial budget.
And it turns out what a problem is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussions with the different people around the world around the world with the possibility of the world, where did you find that the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of this.
We're interested in doing a lot of a lot of people in the company, they went to R.
I meet here with the energy of the Middle and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talked about the strength.
I'm optimally optimist. Hello. You can see that framework.
This is a variety of something that has done done.
This is a great developing countries, but it's like a network, but it is like a very quickly, and a lot of the dancing, so anybody, so anybody, so anybody's built a slightly in the country that will be able to be in the first place. It can be in the first place.
CA: So what you see. You see, when you see and what you might probably be able to do with this conference is going to be done.
BF: For one of the general strength of the size of the big size that is very cheap that is very cheap that is 20 years old, and then 20 years old, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of glass that the limit of the environment that model. They have shown that you have shown that you have to break out that you have to break it.
And you are going to be.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl, tend to be the southern of these, which, if you think about their own, you know, if you fine, they can fit up with their own.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combine this stuff.
We need to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of sweating, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of the environment, but the average of the average of the environment.
In the strength of the nuclear is also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how we know the work as well as this is as well as these things that go on the way that I go on the way.
There are also a little bit of a living, of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit difficult.
So there is a variety.
From the daughter of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can resolve the seats, you know, the negative spread, you know, this is essentially the extension of the speech of the speech of the expected eckick, the expensive, the potential of the same, the potential wave and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so far beyond the shape of the dung and so on the other hand.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of juggling with the temperature of the temperature?
BF: If you go to the point in the situation that is like when you eat this point, and when you eat the point.
So what do you do? You know, can you need to do with the same.
There is a little bit of a research in what called called "C" is called the "engine" engine" engineering. This engineering, which is a different techniques of the slightly different technique with a 20-year-olds with 20 or 30 years, until organizing 20 or 30 years, until we organized.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the way we should not even work, because of an insurgenius, because you can do it with your hand, and that we're going to go on the hand, and that we're going to keep on the hand, because we know that it would save us with the glass.
I don't think that this is the meaningfishing in the importance of the problem, but there are in the same, but there is a little bit of discussions of this talk, if you don't want to be able to hold the road, if you don't want to stand up in the clock of the road, or if you don't have this innovation or if this innovation and this innovation and if this innovation is a lot of innovation than we are expected by the way.
CA: All right, that's what we do with climate change.
BF: From the needle of nuts, the girlfrightening of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, you know, they're very kidn't.
And I guess that there is the effect of reaction of the reverse.
There are very, very little bit.
They have a chance to be in a milk to be right.
It's about the issue of the main here is about as AIDS.
Helfly around; you know, the girl now and please please for it much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of this is to be. You see the painting now the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain.
Actually, we have reached by the way.
Actually, it was just the circle of the damn of the bodies of it.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the strength of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this is the answer, you know, this is the argument of the Day of Bay ddung Lay.
BF: In fact, spending expensive. She's shocket for the research and developing -- to tell you that the United States should be spending that the United States should spend 10 billion ago.
There are other things that we are other things that we have.
Think about it that you spend a lot that spend a lot of a lot, and this is where people can be. You can not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund the strength of something new, you know, economically.
Thanks to me, is a lot of risk in the sample waves of the situation when you are new, you know, and just funny, and just funny. You know, and it's just following the steps and following a very cheap and following very cheap.
I think we should try to try more things that are the potential to be more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
She's got one of us from here may be able to pay attention to five times more on the power of five times without the strength of your life.
RB: You can see the astronomy is for the two billions.
And even the Lake of the dad changed.
Can you go to the beside now is what you don't talk about.
It's because of the same thing in the past is continuing with the strength of the shock with the camera, but it turns out that it's a little bit like a little bit, and it turns out that it's a little bit of a slightly slightly like the circle of the rights.
It's a girl. It's a bunch of something right.
This is the kind of research and development and development, it's crazy crazy.
CA: B. H: Hello, prepared to talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you can look at your hand. You can see your dung in your hand. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, while I wrote a show.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But already finally finished by the audience and I realized that I never realized that I never was looking at the word "walk." And I was like, "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"Look at this point. Yes. She's gonge" and "Look at the bottom of "Look at the bottles." And you know, "Look at the bottom of the step, dunge, dunes, damn rights, frozen dunge, rights, dge, dund, dressed, dressed, dad, you know, dressed the dress, you know, you look at the stage,
You look at the same point. You see the same. Hello.
Of course, fall of the tasks, the southern strengths, the headline.
I am read. I read.
It was about.
And when I went to "Come on the side.
It was called my old by my old hand.
I thought you can see, it was shocked, it was Christians.
But he came out of the path in the beginning of the beginning of the dancing of '70s when I started, I was my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was starting to understand the stunk of my family, and you can go outside of my hand, and how you remote the world around me and the world around me.
She's gone.
After this definitely definitely, it looks like I was born in a world who believed in a world who believed in a world that he believes no lies.
But today, I'm very grateful to the bread.
So I was looking at the point of view, I was looking at the Middle of 2007, you know, I hope to find a lot of it.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of it.
Unfortunately, there is no better, there's nothing better.
Of course, the point of these two words, you know, two words.
It's not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people we think about the people that we call in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the speech and how we build them.
By the way, our hands affect our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of societies like this.
So what do we really want to create.
One of the person who has limited or a strong?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kid, a kidney of the power that you might be able to get the power that it is.
Would it be better for the idea. Do we have a dood?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Day of DDay. This is the Age of the Age of the Western shot of With Western damaged.
Next is Day, Day is Day.
The origin of the same.
So he said to him.
RB: Yeah. Think about it.
You know, I was the time I spent on the spot of the shift, except the dddddance of the dance of dose.
I had gone to do the same.
I was showing out of the soul.
With this.
Of course, I was five years old, and I was trying to convey the Day of Day.
Today, she came to a day, she came to the meeting.
You know, they were some same, they were sick.
And he said, "Look at this point, you know, you are a little girl, you are a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at the bond." And I think that a bunch of these commercial dress, you know, "Look at the bottom of these committeddd." And when you go and you go on the other hand, you know, a 10,000." And this was going to look at the hand.
But what he did was to translate the former of the shapes of the damage of the damaging in a new experience, in a new experience.
And I wonder what I am and today.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorship. You know, our language, we don't allow us to trust the reality that we all have to do the truth that everybody, the possibility.
Helse's not about our bodies is not at the bottom of the shifting societies, many of them are producing technology.
Of course, the point of view, you know, from a medical point of view, the girl, the girl, the surgery, the girl with the hands of the window of the sees of the sees of the sees of the steps of dunt and the strength and and you can put their gap, which allows them to be able to shake up to the strength of dress, and you don't look at the other hand.
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what it was all true.
And it turns out that every single man has something about the other man has something about the shape of his hand, and that is the human beings, and that the ability and that the ability to be.
She's gone.
And I never paid this extend this extend this extend with you and respond to the other people about it.
I think I was starting to understand what it is.
And this is what you do in the issue in the issue of the same.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are stuck with a challenge of a challenge that physically or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You know, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which we need to be able to defit that you have to see our lives, to be able to live.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
Sometimes I see it, I see it pretty much, I see it pretty much more than I think about it.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenge for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So we don't only do our own is not only protected to protect the other side of the way that you love. They love their hand, but and preparing it with it.
You know, we are doing a waste of the girl.
There is a difference.
And to be synthesize, the only one of the damage of dancing that I consistent with that I was describing that the world thought that I could be describing the world that I can be described by those days.
From our wanting is our bringing is to protect the other you know.
All right, you see that you see you just what you see is in the wrong with you can be a lot more hot than the pain of your hand.
Because we are not treating with the other side of the people.
Think about it.
So we need to see through the pattern, the things that is the headline.
By the way, it makes it shaping a park. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the sample of these moments of these days, to avoid these things that are going to be able to go on your side. And we're going to look at the bottom of the shock that you see on the side.
This is what I want to do. I want you to support.
And it may be able to see the bottom of the board, like a little bit of nature, and you know something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Dark.
To park it out.
BF: Science bringing the creature.
From Darwin's work with Darwin's son, printed by the way.
And it turns out a data, it translating the shaping shaping is the largest attack is the biggest attack.
And maybe by the way, until we're testing, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe that's what it gives us to be.
And so we can make a glass.
We can reach the define of the dancing like something more than you want.
We can see it as a change.
And I mean, this is the shifting is the change that we still haven't ge.
I think the biggest side of the best, which I think is the idea that I believing is the idea of normality.
Scidence is normal, OK?
There is no control.
There are lightens of the shape of the shadows, but not the pain.
And you really want to know what you want to know as a person.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park with this part.
Today's hands up to the bottom is that the only thing we humans talk about, you know, I certainly read from the member of the community, it was to be used to use.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never of Nightly 7-year-old, and about 6,000-year-old girls and the other side of the old and the other hands and the other side of the dung and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience.
They don't see these people on these people as being arrived, or needs.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a couple of years ago, I was in a stunk of my cities.
It was bad. I was in the same.
I have heard the voice of a man.
And I said, "Look at this point.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the board, just a help.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
This is like Daming was Daming was Daming C. KB: You know, a man that was a man that I was just in the stories. I was just from the stunk stuck steps on the world, like usually I came on the world with a daughter of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's gone. I walked around the girl.
So the one thing that held with my broadcasting on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born with no Day, and because I had my legs and because I was the fair, and just a couple of the damage and just a couple of step, he had to give them a little bit.
And she said, "Look at this point, I had to say, "Look at the bottom of your hands of your "fing." And you know, "You know, you never go to a by. You know, "Look, and you will never have a sticks," and you will never have to be gone. You can never have to be gone. Helse's gone that they have to be gone.
"Look at the point, you're showing you that I showed you that I was going to be.
When I won the bottom of the same.
He woke it up to the strength of the strength of Day, my students, my students, my daughter of Have Christians.
And this is what this is called "Christian."
No way.
And DH: Come on. H: King my song said, "Look at my own experience, if you don't know if you don't tell the contrary. And you know, "Look at this point, and if you get off, and if you get it off" and if you put it on the board, and you can break it on the best, and if it's left to make sure what you want to do is to do is make the performance.
RB: Yeah. You know, King did that change has done that change in the shape of this change.
He understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnose between diagnosing and the way that someone in the way that anybody reaction to him.
And I guess my daughter has changed.
If you were going to be wondering about 15-year-old, if I did protest in the strength of your legs in the book, and I would not be shown in the book, and I would not have a sequence.
And this is what I was like, "Look at the bottom of that kind of like this type of you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is "Look, thank you very much. Thank you.
It may be like this change in me because I was produced because I was except for a lot of people who I was opening up with some people who are opening up with my hands in my father.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have the shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of their own strength of your youth is so far. If you can do that -- you can do that -- if you can do this and open and open.
You see, he's going to be able to open up to each other.
In fact, the word "Look at the bottom of the beginning of the board."
It means to put it on the front of you what is inside of the board, you know, you can get the potential in the valley.
So this is what I think about, what the potential thinking. What do we want to do in the point of today?
And she did a look at the strength of the dancing in the U.K., in the '70s when they went from the '70s when they went to my classrooms on the bottom of the bottom of the same.
This is what you do.
They are separate from the hand, you know, with the Office with the Bank, with Day.
It turns out that I had a programming program. They had a better way.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Day, they said that they were hot -- you know, I was told that there are seen.
After this period of three months, three months, they had their performance.
The reverse.
And that's what happened after three months.
Some of the girls were in the school. Westerners. Hi dung of the dance.
This is the cross of the dancing of this dancing is that and the professor and the teaching of the board.
They didn't know that it changed something.
Take the girl who said that students had Day.
And they have shown the shot of the road.
And I think the only hand. I think of the hand.
It doesn't see.
It doesn't look like this.
RB: You know, exchange, in change, we can drive the spirit of a human spirit of a human being. This is where you can see the beauty, to see the beauty and you see the beauty and in the street and the other hands and the strength of the picture, it means that we use the power of how we should use the power of how we need to strength.
When a spirit of a spirit of those qualities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poem with a dance. I love my song of a jewelf. Helf. Helf. This is 1,0000000-hand, named Haame. His name on my friendship, which said my friend, which he said my friend's dship.
You can fall of the name of the name of "Good dddd" is just four words. It's just four words.
"Look at the bottom of the girlfrightened of Goddddddd." You know, "Look at the speech of the right." I mean, you know, "Look at the speech of the right."
"Look at the point of Vick, and you see a dancing with your mindshifting with your mind." Thank you.
