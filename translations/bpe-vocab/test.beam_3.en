A few of them are going to be years ago, here at TEDstage of TEDster Day Dutch Close the problem of design here called the Ground problem of design.
And the idea is quite simple.
You can see it on four to four to build some of the most of you have to build the road.
Helf. It has to stand up at the top of the top.
And it turns out, you know, and it turns out that it's quite simple, it's really hard to get people to the point of the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And then I was at the point, I have almost 70 with this slightly 70 people around the world with my students, and designing and designing and designing and designing and architecture and architecture. And the same way in the bottom 50 Fort and something from this show, and something in this hand, and something from the shot and something like this is about the shape of the shock of the shape of nature's learning. Look at the hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: You know, you see the bread, imagining her how to show you how it will look at the seem to be. You can spend a little bit of the shock of the planet.
She's gone. And it takes the shot and throw it up and you see the gap.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at the bottom of the girl, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of the hous," because of the road, because they fall the wrong structure of the road, and you can see the whole structure.
And there is a number of people who have a lot more of the momentum of "Christian."
They are the mind, judgment of dunt and they lose their foods, and it makes her fingertips the structure.
And so of course, I'm a little bit of the damage that has a lot more structure of structure. And this is the bonds of the best, and they're produced by the other hands of the best, and you get the bad.
And it's pretty amazing.
And as you say then. You know, it's not only the profound that it doesn't just like the most interesting structure, but the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
And by Peace; you like to say, "Look at the speech of the kids don't lose the time of the kids are the director of the next generation.
And you don't lose the time of fight by the way.
But it's also another reason for it.
This is that the students are training are training to find out the same. You see that the only thing that the only thing that the right step, right?
And it turns out that I do.
And what happens is that, when you put the gang. Helsewhere, when you go on the top of the flag -- and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they start with the strength of the window, and they're building step.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have an answer to the point of course of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the majority of these, is about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is it? Because they understand them? Because they understand the triangle of the dung and the patterns and patterns and models of the geek step. It's the kind of stable structure.
So, the point of these.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add up with the teams of the teams of a man at the bottom of the speech of the shape of the hand.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner dinner dinner. And why is it here?
Because they have the steps of the stacle of the factory of faces.
By the way, you get the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Common the bottom of the girl, and you can do the other hand, and they get their strength, and the combination of their strength.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have a structure.
And I tried something interesting.
And I thought, okay, you know, let's go to Christian dancing.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in design.
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. His a team of dance not built something that to stand up in the leg.
If you can just be built by the way, to say, "You know, you know, a structure structure of three days, it might be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of the big impacts have a powerful impact on this?
I have a little bit of the picture. And I was exercise with these days.
What did you think that happened?
You know, I think they have done the value of the profound value of the profound of it.
And the same way. And the same team has gone from the worst of the same.
They've got cooking the road, the other struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you could ask the question: Why would you lose anybody and you lose the issue of someone like this.
And the reasoning is, I helpful with the device of the digital hands and the process of the shot and processes using the shape of the shape of what you are building and the game and the game of the shoes and the games and the game of vision.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has his own baby.
And this challenging challenge.
And so, this is the value of this experience, this experience.
And for the one of the other hand, you can get access to the wanting of the wild of the dung of the bread. Hellog in the street. And this is a bunch of step. It's a blog where you can see how to build you see how to build you with the gose.
I'm also the struck struck with the strength of the shock of this.
And I'm also talking about this kind of needle of all around the world of how humans change in the world of how people are changing the system.
You can see the record and the record.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that design is really a piece of content.
We're going to be able to fall of us to the task. We are all the feeling of these things that we have better in your thinking, and applies of what we have better thinkings, and the facts of the challenge.
And it turns out, you know, a simple ball of the same kind of the kind of thing is the only thing that you need to go and turn it into the boss of "bone" in a step.
And this can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's put it on the southern on the stem of the step, a machine, a car.
And all of the outside of the boundaries in this room, you have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or before you go back, but you can't remain is where you are.
I wonder what I'm going to be. You know, I mean, you know, I put my friendships, and I put my friendship, and all they wanted to be.
I don't know. You don't want to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other side of the I.D. jjjew."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I don't do any of this grand.
I don't want to go back to the base of time and not because I don't have a spirit of advance. I don't think about the board, but because of the option of the option of the option.
So, I want you to look at it in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this plane of a look at the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, and you see the stage of stagging stage.
It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It also makes a life like this.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I divided before I was going to get 6.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my father is my face. You know, I get close to the 1,000-bread.
So it would be good to be thrightly near the beginning of the bottom of the bottom of that I'm going to die that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
His besigh with this. This is an incredible phenomenon. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
She's gone.
And it turns out that the philosophical data of the plane of the planet.
It doesn't work.
I have gone of the girl.
In the rich world, the same, you know, the saming world, they have millions of people with only a generation.
RB: You know, the sample of the board.
You know what?
You see the same.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
From the daughter, there is no longer and there is no longer the problem, because there are other things that are other than one of them is that weird, one of them is that weird, a billionth of people are fighting on our shelts every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
By the way you go. She's gone.
If we don't invent a little bit of a way to come out of the way to come out of this bread, we're going to fall of us.
You know, I mean, can we do this: Can we do this? I think that yet.
And I think it's obviously like we can produce food that we can produce foot that we can eat the bottom of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can dig this world with energy that doesn't destroy the energy that will not be destroyed.
I really think this is not just an ill.
But here's what I'm not going to want to want to want to see the note -- one of the things that I don't leave it with me.
I never had a bigger progress that you need to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the situation of the way to use it in the situation of how we can do today.
We're in the prison of a little bit of a lot.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should go back three hundreds of years ago, before E.
People are cross of the same.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
Everybody's right here is justice to the opposite of the day; it really has the right thing to have a speech to have a flaw on the street. You know, but you know about what you haven't got a right notion of what you have?
You don't have the right of your own speech to your own state.
And it took me a little bit of my time.
An 10 years ago, I wrote a piece of paper about vaccines for "New York" for "The New York" -- a little bit of a little bit.
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did do with him, so I did what I do is usual. I wrote a piece of paper.
She's gone.
That's the same way. And the same thing as it is only one more important.
People were going to take a bond.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and I can't see how the people who believes that people believed in my hands that people believed that he was "Child of Frank" -- and why they believed the molecule change the molecule in a certain way that he believed the molecule in a way of rights, not in the shape of the shape of glasses of the damn of the damn of the dung of nature.
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, I do do with my house. I wrote the articles, I went on.
I mean, I am a dynamics. His judds; you look at the bottom of the bodies, and you go to a dinner dinner dinner, all of the step.
But these articles me. They have gone of the damn and you don't see me and I realize which, I realized why.
It was because the sample of her fingertips that I'm going to go out of my mind. You know, there were no flag in my mind.
They were boring people with the grandfather of the girl,
They were just like the people in this room in this room.
And it turns out my bread.
But then I thought, "Look at this point.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
You can fly of the flaw of it.
You can see the bonds of it. We are about it in the term of dying. You can put it between the glass and you can put it on the street.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
And we have lost our fact. We lost the trust of the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall of you can see a couple of names and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. Hello. Hello, Bay.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you get the question, "Look at the question, you know, you get the damn and you can see it.
You don't have anything good at all.
But here's what this is the idea: when you get the dres: when you get to the point of view, you don't have to act.
And I can say because we are in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the street that I don't know how much and I don't see it.
An 12 years ago, he published an article in the paper, one of the same, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines and vaccines and vaccines against the shock and the river and the right-handed articles.
Very girl. Helf. Helf.
And they did not do this.
I really needed to be doing the sample of the smoke.
They came and they came up with it.
RB: You know, you see the bottom of the United States of the United States, from the Britain, in Scidence of the 19th and all said to the same paper and all of the same paper and all the same thing that there was no climbing cool, there is no climbing cool.
It's not confused to be.
We don't believe a lot of flood documentary of documentary dying.
But you know?
You know, the girl, the girls were disappearance of the girls and here is what the United States and here's what the United States is a little bit of a little bit of the world in the world, which is one of the village in the world in which rubber of breaking.
This is the stage of the same. Helsewhere, you should be the route to the doors.
This is great.
What happened to the point I was going to be here?
You know, I understand it. It really understand.
Where does anybody on the bottom of the bottly?
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It's not really happening.
In this summer doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen, but it happened to 1,000,000.
A bunch of thesis of a deck of the bridge, 20 cases of the bottom 20 cases, 20 cases on the top.
But, because here was not happening, we can not think about this and people like Jesus and people like Jesus. This is McC. Come here.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we need to learn this as the cure of the cloud.
And this guy, Jesson, Jessed. Her St.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Helf, no fingers; the policy of dying. His fly around.
Take the town in the middle of the bottom of the bottle.
His name name name name is Pay.
Trist.
She's gone.
By a result, right?
It's the good, just that PaPaul talks about it by the hands of the girls and how they are the pregnant and how people should slow and that people should just slow.
And this is what it is.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. When he talks in a audience in the audience, you can't fall of the same. It can't be protected by the way.
This is the soap because people like people like people like to say, I know what I call her children go to my children go to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the boundaries, you get sick, you know, you see this is where it goes on.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse, and in the same, the children are going to die. And it's going to go through this, and it is just a statistic.
And they will not die.
How about the pollen with the poll. She's gone.
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fact. It was a little bit of facty, and he told me that I'm kind of a bunch of me.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have a check and vaccinated with the baby against the pollen against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen cases of the sky in this room.
But today, I don't know. You know, maybe a guy, a kind of spending in the morning in the morning in a planet.
You can see the same way.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend to be like this.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
The Chinese dancing, you know, a little antify of oxive oxygen to work.
You know, I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
You know, they have these things and applies to the medicine with the alternative.
And the girl looks at every time.
You know, I'm doing it.
It's just okay, you know, you want to pay for 2,000 billion dollars for it.
Next. You know, you see the dogs.
Look at the point of view. She's going to the bread.
Why do we do this stuff?
I think you know, I think -- the snapshot of the sample of the fish.
You see the rights, we don't have the same. We don't have any consistent.
And I should not have to have it.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so fly around. And so we can be.
RB: You can see in the arts of the same.
This is fantastic. This is fantastic. I love the snake.
But, in fact, it's a very serious about these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all sorts of objection --
Next. She's one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, people look at me and say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point, you know, you're going to be able to do the other people to do the people to do the same.
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't care about it, if my brother's secret of the state of the state of the Western Spanish. This is the name of the Western is the one that says "Cloud," he says, "Look at this point, you know, and it turns out to take it out of the shoes of the shock with the glass of the shock and it's a slightly like to look at this point of a little bit of like this.
When you go to the road, you go on the road, and the map and the magic and the same. You can see the strength of the strength, you get a little bit of a place where you don't know. You know, you want to know how to find yourself.
You know, you can see on the sample of South Africa of Tex.
It was killing 4,000 people are more than 00-and-and-handling nuting judging at the bottom of the shock of the boss and and bank you for the hands and the dung of dunes are effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively more than you know that we know that we know that we know know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
She's about thousands of decades of thousands of decades.
Please. You know, I don't tell you that there's no idea that there is no consequence.
There are gone.
The lack of the lack of the sample of the same.
It's a controver.
It's a controver. It is a bunch of speech at the speech of speech --
This is the idea, not science, science.
I mean, I have my hands of hand, every board.
In the gardening of the girl, you don't exist. It doesn't exist.
And no fish.
There are no way that they were gone.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Something were on the rules of the bottom of it.
I got down the road.
So now we can do it in a different way.
You see, there are some of the strength, there is the risk.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the wast, and this can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
Don't you want to do this?
I have to be married by the way. I don't understand.
And we are doing this test, we are changing against the bottom of the modify of the genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We're not going to be able to be.
We're not going to be able to be.
You know what I mean, is the answer to all that I mean to all this?
Yes, you have speed. You know, you look at it. Let's reach that.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is not.
This is legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
This is a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work, and the other hand, but the idea that you don't have to allow them to be able to allow them to be. His to be able to show you the strength and make a little bit like this, and it is very smart and you see it really cool and showing us in the sample millions of people to stand up with a glass of millions of people to look at the state.
In the next 50 years will be going to have to be able to build with 70-year-olds more hand than the other hand.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't need it.
Why? Why? Wow, you know, you change the genetic lot.
So we don't want to encourage to the people to eat people to eat the bottom of the shock of the shock of the shock of what you would be man.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a car.
Take the same.
Next. She's going to be. His gone.
And then people will be able to eat it with no way to anybody.
Would you not suffer on the fire and you know.
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go, why do we have.
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it like this: Why is it with you?
Because we don't want to change the gene of this.
It's just about the same thing about the gene.
It's not about our birds of our lifestyle for Christians.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know what?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We cannot see it anybody else happens.
This is the today's bad, it's going to the bread, it's under our level, and we even have to start slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, the incredible damn of frogs, you can say, "Look at this point, you can see in this book, you know, you look at the bottom of this book, and you see the stage of the shocket?"
Helf. She's going to be.
Now, this is what you do is like to do is stepped in the presence of the show, but we have an opportunity.
We can programming. We can do the sees of any of you want.
We can move it out of the strength of it.
We need to stand with these discussions and we have to think of this. We have to think about it.
I know that we can also see that we can also see the world has just what the world need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, in a day of the wall of you with the Day of Steve.
And it was a man, a human, an African-born African-jewelf. Helsewhere, a dung of glassroom, a dung in the streets, a gymously, the stunk that he only had two cooking.
And I tell you a story that many of you know, because Steve and he wrote a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, with the R&amp;queues; you know, like Stews. You know, like Step Jkkkkkkkkket. And James and Jamames like Datht dk and Jamamamamames like the dance of dad.
Next. His gentlemen, and he was reached to the school, he went to the school, he went to a bunch of the show, and 30-year-old, and 30 years later and 30 years later, the road, he lived on the street of the right-hand side, lights on the bottom of the side of the river of the dge.
You can see the computation of everybody's going to look at the book's book, or you can see the filter of you and see the shopping of the shock that formed between these two people, but how the muscle between these two people, but how does it helps with these two people, and how he has been instruments, and it was the device, and it was on the other hand, and then he was a little bit of the shape of the shape of the slightly in the way that you help in the way of the rightly rightly in the ge.
And I met my dad and I meet on the stage.
Trike the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the feeling of the sample of the front of you and four, and the four-and-day six, and she came back to the stage and came back to the stage and the shot.
Very dung in a very game in a very game and societies of Yet and societies of Yet and Hi. Yet and Hi. And you know, Cary and H. Cary and Carikick, and how those who will never get to the end of a shock in the end, and all of a strength of a shock in the last slightly in the last slightly in the last hand.
I was talking about the music. I was talking about the muscle of you have a few days later, I was a few days later Jever. And he said, "No." And he was interested in the hands of a living.
Now, I have to mention that Next Nets. His jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet with the right-hand side. And this is the slightly and shot shock and mark it on the shock and you see it on the side, and that's what they will remain your life.
But as a result now, is the pregnant thing about these fish.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of the girl as he explained it as he explained it by the way, and you get a little bit of shock in the streets of the Skkkkkkkkkkaches in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkill of the rights, with the other side of the ribbbread.
And Next. His gentlemen, he was very aggering when we started our first lessed when we started our first late of the Western wounded by the Dutch had a kind of sick, he was a kind of sick. It was lost the dying.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the strength and fly and she is how someone stopping him.
And I was frame, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started playing with it.
And I sing the first part of the concert of the concert of his life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech of speech in your eyes in the eyes of ND.
It was like how it was the influence.
And it turns out the way.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see his own step, and he started, and he started playing with his son, and he started playing with her hands on the street of the concert of the concert of the concern that rights, some of my hands on my hands me to dressed the right-hands on my hands me to the bread. With the dress,
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Day of Day. And I was like, "Look at this point, and Brazil, and Brazil, and Brazil. His Bring. Toky Dutk's dung of the letter of the letter of the ridge, from the rights, by Ekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkill in the hand.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You can see the bread. It's about it with that passage with that passion and understands the shadow that you with my song with my daughter from the movies of the movie.
And while I was on the bottom and I was talking about the man and I was talking about this man in a human being. It turned out of a bunch of dindinner, and you see what he just came up with the street on the street on the street on the street on the streets in the center of the right-hands in the bottom of this muscle of the right-handed museum,
It's like this.
And for Next.
Because the music allows it allows to take their own thinkings, and you know, and you can see them and you can see them through the images and creation through the images and creativity, and the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. It is an event from the strength of the suffering.
And I understood that this is essentially the strength of the art.
This is the reason why we do the music we do the museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and the help with our brains and our artifacts, with our artists, with our creativity, and the path of these emotions that are our emotions, and we see these emotions that are in reality.
And the reality of the steps of the extending us to all of us, and you get us on the board, and you look at the dot and our hand.
And for Next.
You can fall of the release of the muscle of the muscle of him, and you go back in a family.
I will always do the music with Net.
Thank you.
Plll. His a boss; thank; thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the GD.
RB: You can see the same. Good ddddddge something I want you to sing without the board. I want you to stand be.
So, please.
I am Jessons McK: High Listen thinking. I'm an designer. I'm an design.
I think about the game.
And my goal for the next to the next decade is to try to the dot of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves to build more world, including the more world, including the present of the presence of the present here to spend a lot of time play.
So the press of the damage of three billion hours per week on the week of the shock of the show.
Some of you can think of some of you might think about it. It's very much time of you can think about the game.
Maybe too much of the time it helps you see how how many problems we have to solve this gene in the real world. We have to solve the real world.
You know, the same, confidence of my dung of my dung dancing Instead, of course, is exactly on the speech of speech, is exactly on the side.
Take billions of hours on the road, it's not in your hand, it's not in your game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers too.
So, this is probably a little bit of a little bit like this.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it up with it.
If we want to solve the problems like fire. And if we want to be.
This is why. This is a succeeding of what I think is about what I think is playing the games are so smokly the stage of the next slightly the next slide of the next slightly of the other hand.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a picture of a picture called the Plllddge Trik.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shock of the shot shot of a room, as I was in front of the today's songs, while you are playing.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you are not a rubber of dance could lose a part of the notion of this photograph of this picture.
You know, you can see that noticed you needly needs. You know, you need to go to the dress, but focused on the hand, but focused on your hand, you know, the emotion of a very difficult problem for a very difficult problem for a very difficult problem.
If you're a playful playing. You can see how you see a few of the flaw of the dung of the bread.
And the same.
This is a hair.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A wall of the way that is a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary, you don't have any crew that you don't think you can touch it.
It was almost almost beyond the limitation of the slide of the picture.
And when you get you up there you are so sweating to discover that you are really heavy.
This is a today's way to get a way to get a window.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that solve the people who solve you with the world as we try to remove the way we try to remote the stage of the next century.
Fourish. Helf. His going to be which, with you which, on the way to get a window.
So now I'm sorry, this is a face that is a face that we see more often in our life, as we see us as far as we see here.
This is what I call """Look, I'm not good at life."
And this is where I do. You see, he's doing this fair of the face. Can you see? Yes. Can you go.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at all.
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in the box of my neighborhood.
From Berk! Scientist of the girl, where I took my doctor's Ph.D. C: The reason why we are the best thing that we are better than in the real life.
And this is a problem that many games that you have.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't mean to the grandfather of "Look like in "Wow, even though this is a component of a whole bunch of different in the games than in the shape of the game, but when I say good about doing it as a good life and motivated me to do something that conconfidence of doing something that conconsistent to the point of doing something that confidence and you look at how to collapse and you can look at the other hand.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us become the best version of us becoming our best version of ourselves, the most disappearance to help you in a database in a database, the most likely to go through a slightly as a problem, as you need to right-hand issue issues as a little as I was going to step.
In the real life, when we're kidn’t at the bottom of the speech, when you confessed with the strength of the shock of the shock of the shops, the most often don't feel like this.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We don't have any kind of the feeling of these feels like when we played up, you just don't have in your game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I was finished by the way.
What is that in the games of the games that make sense sense of feeling like this safety of safet?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and apply them to the work in the real life in the real life in the real life in the real life.
So I looked at the games of the games like the World War III. With With the dress, which is really a cold environmental environment.
And I started to see a few things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the bonds of the glass.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere in your hand, you know, one of these kind of games like this game in the World War k of the Western Western stunk step, meetings, you know, a lot of personal personal character, and you know, there's a lot of character that I'm willing to be.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingerprint with your fingertips in your game?
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remote with you.
But this is the limit of what you can do. You see on the board.
But there is no snake.
There is no state.
There's always something cloud and important to do this.
And also, they also are tasted by the way.
You can see where you go, you know, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you to work with you on the same.
It's not something that is possible to easy.
And in addition to it, it's also this story of the girl, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard about the growth of the rise in the level and pleasant at the bottom of the board, and please.
We don't receive the girl of the girl life."
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the speak of the talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, in fact, pleasant ideas lightly lighting.
I don't receive this girl's feedback in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environment of the collapse of the world as the World War k of With Wait is that it's so satisfy to be on the shock of the shock of the shock of a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of the glass.
It's just better like in reality.
So you know, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War IIIIII. With 5. Hello. Hello, 30-year-olds up with the other hands and the virtues of the shots of the Age of the Age of the shock.
Now, this is not necessarily anybody.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'll put that in the context of the girl: 5,000-year-old girl, three million years of our first step.
That's what the same thing was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much of the time we are in the present of the games of the game, the only way that means, the only way we think about it is to speak for the magnitude of the magnitude, what this is an extraordinary thing is an extraordinary.
But it's the right thing. Because it turns out that you can see that by spending through the park of the game so much time playing the games of the game, we're really changing the way we are able to do what we are able to do with the human being.
We are evolving to a spectrum of a little bit of collaboration.
That's true. I think that's true.
So, you know, you look at this statistick of the damn interest.
It was published by a recent research at the University of the New York City.
And I mean, the other side of you.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kids that you're going to spend that you will spend on my hands in my classrooms and by the hand, and until I finish. You know, if you never lack of the shot.
So we have a whole bunch of you dance with the park of my education that is going to happen in the young girl that people are going to be like a lot of about what you need to be a bunch of what you need to be a bunch of what you need to do with the rest of the street.
And some of you may probably be reading with the new damn of Mext of Mexico.
So, you're going to be heard of the damn of the success of the 10,000,000.
It's based on the same. You can look at this extraordinary research.
We're going to be as good as we do as well as the biggest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking forward is a whole generation now is a whole generation.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Look at what they become the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend in the world that spend at least one of the day.
These are the girls are the game.
500 million people who are extraordinarily aware of the grandfather of something.
And in the future. We're going to be another billion of the today's going to be a glass that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
Indeed, you know, fit of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shock of the bread.
This will bring us to 1,000-billions of play.
So I started thinking about what these games do these games do these games.
These are the four things that I discovered in the first place. The first thing is optimist.
OK.
You can see the candle of the dung of the damn is wishing to the strength of the sky of a shock in front of a shot shock with the shock of the shock of the shock that we have a chance that we have a chance of strengthen.
You know, I always have credn’t believe that a window wwall of it is possibly going to try to try and do it now.
You know, they don't stand stand the steps of the dung step.
You know, the girls are the experiments of the clock of a glacier of the box of the box of the strength.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you played us with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reason is that it requires a lot of trust. It takes a lot of trust to play.
We have the credit credit that someone will spend their time with us, that somebody with us, and that will play with the same bonds and the rule of the same bond, and you will look at the same point, and that they will go to the end.
And that's what you do with a game with someone with a game with someone really building with a shadow with a bunch of the credit and the cob.
And as a result, we are building with social relationships, the societies.
You know, you are going to get the happiness. I love that.
You know, there's a little bit of a game that played the average of the World War IIII. His broken like 27. His 27. You know, two, though, though, though, though, thinking.
It's because you know, when we played a game with a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the street, you go to the besip or when you go away.
We know what we know is what we are optimal.
And the today's gone of these are available.
And finally, you know, the same.
You know, I love my song to be attached to the dance of the mountains that inspired by the stories.
So, just a little bit of trigger to help us see the way to help us see things in the perspective.
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the world.
The second is to the second largest wife. Hi, with almost 8,000-year-old day-to-day articles is the World Wark.
You know, millions of people use a million people who use every month of the moon.
They've got a little bit of a little bit of information about the World World of the War dance of the world than any other side of the subject of the subject of the subject of a shock in the world.
They are built by the way.
They are confused by the way. You see a resource of the knowledge of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the strengths of hope.
They are people who believe that I'm capable of individual dancing to change the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world to change the worldwide, but not the virtue.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
This is an economy called the E.D. . . Christian.
And I mean, it's the gene is the gene of dying. He studies the people investing so much of the time and energy in the world and energy in the world.
And he says, "We're going to be margin, "We're talking about what you do.
I mean, you know, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I'm not as I -- I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of claim because the player can get more in the list of the world.
You can see the same societies of social life.
They received the girl, and they feel better worse, and I feel worse worse worse than you are in the games than in the game.
So, he tells you now, it's a claim of a shape of the players to spend more time in the world in the real world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the raising of the same, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world more like a game more like a game more like a game like a game here.
And so, I traveling my hands in something that happened in something that happened to 2,000-year-old.
These are the spot of ankly ankly created from the window.
You know, at the end of being controlled with extraordinary.
And this is the first teaming of the games of play.
And if you are born familiar with the work with the work of the work of the other side of the mistake of the house.
Which is the history of everybody's invention that invention of the games and why.
Hi. She's going to be.
You know, it was so much like this was a bunch of flaws. The lamp of the L.D. . His decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are sick. People are going to be sick. People are going to work.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of Hi. Today's wife, and they invented the games of the games of the window and definitely definition and definitely definitely definitable in the room.
You know, one day, every day, of them will ever.
And the next day is going to be playing.
And it will be so focused on the games of the shopping of speech because the games are so sold because the games are so solving us and learn how to go and teach us in a product and learn how much satisfy they don't have any satisfyet. And they will ignore the fact that they haven't ignore the fact that they did not have some hand.
And so the day of the today's game. They have the game, you know, a duts, you know, a dung in your hand.
And it turns out to be with Hi. Today's breast, they lived in the room of 18-year-old lights survival.
Now, this is what I think is this: I think of the way we use play.
You can fly around. We have the games of the sample to fall of the suffering.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfy in the road, all of our life and our lives, and our lives, our life and receiving what we need in the game, we need in the game.
But I don't have to do it here.
This is very interesting.
By the point of viewer of H: County, after 18-year-old girl, after 18-year-old girl.
And so, the way they decided that they would play a shock a bunch of gap.
They did. They have a whole bunch of gap.
They have played a game of flood dancing, and the window, and win the window they got the chance to go in a hand.
They're going to leave you and LB: They are going to be.
And they will go to the caught of a new place where to lie with you on the board, he left at exactly the same points of the people how to survive with the slide of the slightly the roads that were disappearing the resources that were disappearing the resources that would be disappeared by the way, and you can see the other hand, and hoppe.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot showing you some of the girl, which they have the strength of the sky that they have the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA, you have the same way and the old you have Ladikkkkkken.
And this is what we look like the south of the southern story of HGee. She's the great story, he could be true.
And the way they found out of the box and you can see the legs of a bunch of globe.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save their living. They were gone.
OK, we can do that.
We are playing with With Western dancing in 1997.
The girl was the first game was the first game of the strength of the Western time in the world of the Way of Wart. This was 16.
They were playing. They played the games of gaps for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 1,000-year-old.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-and-a-billion hours of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeeding half of us to get a half of us to play a half of us to play a glass a half of the steps on the other side of the games until you solve the truth of the lives.
Now, I know you ask you the question, "Look for how can we solve the problem of your life expectancy in the games in the games of the game." Well, this is the bon?" Well, this is thright." Well, that's my work in the last few years, at the last few years, at the last few years, at the last few years, at the past few years, at the same time.
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. and you can see on the opposite of what we are going to try to talk about what we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
So what we want to do is make the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage of the stage,
And then we want to stand up with the people to translate the people to translate this stage.
We want to look at this point, you know, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of those to the midden those to you get these windows of the windows of the window.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Law of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
She's gone. And this is the way of own, but we put it out there as much as you can put it out there so that you can think about it is reality, and to live your lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay. So when you don't have okay. So when you look at this game.
And then you can get your too. We can see the strength of the data that you look at exactly how much you can look at exactly how much you get your own, which is not disappeared by the hand, it's not gone. It turns out the snake, how it is affected, if it's a little bit of the hand, if you get a little bit of the shape of the shape of the shape of the gain.
And you have to imagine. You have to show you how you lived in your life if all this would be true. And then you can see you with the hands in a block of the hands in a blog of a bunch of filmmakers, and the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to go to the chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because this is what it is.
But if you include it in one hand, you know, you see it on the wisdom and you say, "Look, you know, "Look at the bottom."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is a fantastic where you get your boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
And I mean, you know, the today's playing.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world with you in the past, bigger than the lack of own, bigger than the lack of own.
And I mean, I created a game called SuperCount SuperCount.
And the pregnant thing was that a super-computer. It was a computer.
Suppt. She's called the Cloudly called the GD. H: Hello. His ge.
I have a little bit of the people to come up with almost like in an online movies like in Jesus Bring Bring.
You know how the filter of June of Jamary Christian Bring. Helf. His shared by the way.
You can get astronomy of the strength of the sky, the damage of science.
But in our game.
Today's 8,000-and-a-thousand people who have played this game.
They were invented by 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you go and see if you go and look at the bonds and search struck.
So, finally finally fine, the last slide of the next step.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a graduate year. And we have a show.
You know, I would like to invent you to all of you to share this game with you with this game with you with the people in the world, particularly in the world, especially in the world, particularly in the developing world, particularly in the development of the development that may be met with their own, to try to see their own shadow to imagine.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are kind of version of what we could do with the steps of what we could do with a whole world.
You know, I think you will agree that you will agree with me that too.
We all have these super-powered strength of the amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of the light-handed social and this feeling talk, and this feeling of optimism and wanting and dance to have a sense of breaking.
And I hope in the bottom of the soup that we can see us play.
And it's my hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the next deck of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And I think we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play the step.
So, you say, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am really interested in the exist of the same.
Of course, the same way, the cloud of the sample of the flap of a slightly effect of the hands of the hands of the hands of the hand, because the person's hand, just because the person is what happens is an effect, or something like the people who are happening, or something like -- or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
You know, a girl. It becomes a real way that someone in a way that someone in a perception.
So to look at the speech that I want to start by show you a trick.
And I'm going to show you how this is a trick. This is a trick that you find out of the damage. You know, for kids still 1,000.
And I learned, I learned from Christians. The St. Spain.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
You can see the same. Here, where you can look at the bottom, which you can look at my hand, you can see it.
So I'm going to take you on the hands in the hand.
I'm going to try.
And in order to make sure that anything that nothing to do in your hand, or you don't look at my hands from my hand. I will fit up here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the bottom of the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open up the hand, and I hope that it is, if it all good, you know, if it all goes on to the animal kingdom.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can fly that I can slow your hand.
Not circle or somebody's going to be in your hand, without the hand, no flow. And you can look at it.
Take it.
Helfly of the girl, you learn how this is the other side of the other side of the strength of the mastery of the mastery of the step, because you can travel a lot of about the shock of the shock of the show. You really simple if it's very simple if it's very simple to done.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I tell you that I'm going to get my hands with my hands to my hang my hands to me that somewhere in this room is a little bit.
The reason why I think about what I do with with my hands in the prison is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time, my hands are moving on the front of you see in front of you and you don't see it. You know, and you don't see it on the bottom of the shock step, and the shot is going to go through a shock show.
Helf.
It's a child without a kid without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I graduate with my snake, my finger fingertips her hand.
And we can talk about what you can look like you in this hero's own, why you don't not.
But this is not everybody.
You can fall of the board, you know, it's not going to be there, not through the magnitude of the bodies, but through a shock of my hand.
And then when you look at the dot of the smoke.
I give my hands up to a part.
You know, this is the same. You can do this friends and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I read a quote study, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock of the research. So this is what this is amazing.
It turns out that if you add your minister. You see a step.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the shape of the strength of your strength, you get a little bit of a little bit, you make a blue boss and you get a shape of a shape and you see it has a shape of the slightly slightly higher effect.
Of course, no one of these pasts have no subject of these days, they don't have the fish. You know, the fish.
But the past.
DH: What does it leave me with my mother.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, I'm more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
An steps on the road, the same, the yield in a headline, and the road, and the road. And the other thing is better than the bottom of the bottom of the street.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you -- not as good as you can. It's not as well.
But the idea is what it is.
-- and you know, and the dot of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the best, you know, the best. You have to go on the bottom of it.
Right? You know, a series of a little bit.
So it's an image so powerful, for them, much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
Helfly is that the phase phase is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way.
And there's no way there is no queue.
You know, just fit just by our belief in our body, and it makes our brains and produce a more powerful effect.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I make it fish.
And we know from that studies in the hand, that if you want to use it.
This is a hurt of sea sees of the seven.
And I'm going to stand bread.
That's my hand.
This is the skin.
I'm going to cover the piece.
If you are born with the same. You see it -- if you go to the bread.
So, you know, you look at the point that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't know why, you don't get the first part of the seven.
You're going to see, you will look at a different part of the other side if you will.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gose.
I mean, I'm sorry.
And now I'm going to go through the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
I was doing something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you show them then.
Yes, of course,
I know what people think you think when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud that you can fall of us on the bottom of us on the other hands of us a few minutes. You look at a few minutes. Take a few minutes.
What does it look like? Yes.
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at the bottom of it.
Let me show you good.
This is really the pigeon.
This is my career.
You know, I ask you the same. If you look at it. If you look at the bread, you know, you don't look at it.
And they go from the back, or those who want to look at over the last few years to record the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff, it looks pretty curious stuff, but if you would have a gone. If you had a gone of the gap, if you have a hole in there and you can go out there, and you can look at the dose, and some of your hand.
Helf, okay, you know, okay.
You see, I now I'm going to take the same.
And I was like, I guess my hands and you can look at the bottom of my hand.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little girl, and this is what I'm going to do with this kind of remote -- and I'm going to leave it on the stage.
We can see a few days, some of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the same. Thank you very much.
So, I met a whole bunch of fishing with my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first thing was more like a little bit more like a bird business.
It was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the other standards of the other standard.
So you can just be. You can see when you come up with it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
You see, in a day, the sample of his wife, and she asked me if she asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at this point, I said, "Look.
This is a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men's men?
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans and the oceans like I deforest.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fish of the sample that I loved the sea that you love. She's lotttttty, your hand, you know, the fish, your hand, you know, and the bonds have gone.
That's what I mean, they have gone that they did.
So on the good or of the bad, you see the clock of the fishing of my fish. You get a little bit of our future.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fishery fish. His fishing in the least, at least most of them do it -- and they have a show.
A lot of fall of the way.
Take has a little bit of the conversation of the conversation of the girl is 15th of 15.
That means that you need 15-and-and-it-and-it-by-bread.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So here's the end, in the end, it was a company that I try to do it.
And I wanted to be.
And the day of the day I was showing the shot of the same.
Helfly named Dame.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point of the point, you are Christian, because you are Christian. You see your fish. You see the bread, you don't policy.
"Come on the bottom of the bottom of it. We are so far as far as far as far as far as far as the strength of the fishing of the fishing of our girls are not concentrated, I'm not focused on the bottom of our bone."
And then he adds up to him, "Look, we are actually a world of new world.
RB: You know, this is the conversation of the girl's dame?
"Look at the best, the better on the skyet."
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. She's five to another fifth of what?
"Helsewhere. You know, you get dying. His fecing with it.
"Helse's bond," I was like, "Look, I finish," I finally find. I find.
And in that night, I was born, I was trick, I was traveled in my hands and thinking: What nuts is a protest is a protest is a protein with you?
So the second day before the event of the events, I call it D.
I said, "Yeah, you go, let me show me some of the protest of protest of protest of protein. He said that you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the same.
Next one could not be able to give me an answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist biologist.
Helfly named Day, and he's D.
"Yes I go, I said, "Look, you know, I love some of the protest of prote" as a protest of protey." Well, you know, you get a little bit of a shadow and a little bit, and then something that makes up and then a little bit, and then he said, "Look, and then he said, "Look, and then he said, "Look.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the kidn't.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the step, the steps of the bond" of the bonds and processes and processing and processed it in the hands and process.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the damn of you."
You know, you look at this point, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two profound each other.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of the sam."
"Yeah, what it is sustainable to be. You can see in the board.
It was a shock of the girl, and he said, "Look, and he said, "Look at this point, I'm just too many of you in the world."
DH: Hello. It was my stage for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass of the next to the virtue of the glass.
In fact, they are.
Next. I was feeling like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love of the love of the love of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of you know how much you know how you get it out of the damn of it.
You see, I was sitting in the room as I hang in a restaurant at the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of the girl's friendshifted by a lot of time.
It was kind of the kind of arguing us the meeting.
He came to the mom in a bunch of blue bread, lightning light, almost scale.
She's gone.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
While can do it as a fish to have a seat to be able to get the good after he was finished too much.
I don't know, but this guy, I don't know.
Helfly named Mikle East.
In fact, the name is the name of the girl.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bunch of those.
It's a fish. Helf. Helf.
It's at the bottom of the same.
The 19th of the 19th of the 190s was in the hands of my hands were in the hand.
They are growing up. Think of it in the areas that was actually a bunch that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they have geled the water from the stage of the stage of the rights, back in the rights.
But they could not make it work.
And the screen of the girl was a disruption.
He killed 9/11, 1,000-year-old, which for this place, which is for this place for a lot of bird.
So in the 1980s a Spanish. She's going to the strength of the strength of the strength of bread.
What did they did?
They've got the same.
They've got coming.
Instead of showing you the sample water, they used the water, they used the frogs of the flow.
They've got the same.
They created a fish. You can see my boss; they have 1,000-hang of 1,000-year-olds -- bboss -- bread. This is a baby -- and you see the dog -- and you see it -- and this is -- and this is -- and this is where they are all the way -- and this is what they have the sample of the dancing of the dance.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take the bonds of the bonds of the sample that is in millions of miles of the damn of the dung and all you see the channels, and everything you see and the road, and everything you see and the steps and the ground.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a kind of same.
OK? Of course, yeah. So here's what you call us here.
This is what it looks like a window with the same.
So now you can see the needle needs.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group that you reminds that reminds them of the bond."
And I found that Mr. Science of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing in the Park of Middle East.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "Look at the bottly? I don't know.
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the bird of the board, and you see the steps and the step.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was the girl, and I was my gone after that piece of fishing the dollar fish, you get too much, which I consumption that I consumed in the street.
So I wondered. I guess. I said, "Look, you know, I guess what your fish. You know, what you do with your hands to be so swe?"
He showed up to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, philosophical strength of the strength of the step. It fits of the plankkkkk." And this is amazing.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation. Helsewh?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a system like this is a system like thickens, the fish. Helf. Helfly of what would be handed by the hand.
Sciden. It's like this plan, and the plane of this.
She's gone.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
More than I was in that day, I was a card with this properties with this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look for a place that looks like like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far" -- and you know, "Look that I was will, "Look at this point, you know?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing spot of the best, thousands of these, though, thousands and thousands and thousands of birds and thousands of birds and thousands of the bonds of the bonds are going to the bread. You can see how you see the roke.
"You know, this is successful," he said.
"Look at the bottom of the fishing of their room.
It goes on to the bottom of the damn today.
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't get the same.
"Yes.
"Come on. With 20 produced 20 produced by the bottom of our fish and from our fish and our fish.
Well, the last year. And this is the properties of 60,000 footprints on her houses on it, more than 25.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
His claimed up with the headline.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the flow. His fingertips.
Please sees of the meal of the snake.
So as you can fly is the same, the more is the better system.
All right, let's go and recently, to the point of too.
A farming that you don't hurt their hasn't gone.
A fishing fish. His fishing, but a sanity.
Of course, by the way, those birds, those birds, those birds of the flowing flow. It should not even be there.
They look at the place in a city of 1,000-kilomeach, you know, it's the way that you are better at the same time, where conditions are better to build their hands to build the step.
In every morning of the road, she fly 2,000-kilomeach.
And every night, they fly around, and they fly 25-kilomeach.
They do this because I'm going to be able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of the same.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly through 2,000 kilometers of 1.
And they do this for the kidney of the bound?"
She's looking at me as I looked at me as a quote reading in a song of songs of Whitokay.
He said, "Look at the point. No.
I don't mentioned the stunk of the same.
I don't like that.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I give it to a little bit of every time.
Everybody, and when I guess I guess this restaurant at the bottom of the southern St. Today, he didn't have a bunch of glasses.
You know, he was a joke.
So I mentioned this girl, and he is what he and he was like, and she is then.
He said, "Look at the same time.
It's the last slide of the defense in the same,
And this is evolutionary to about.
And then he adds up to him, "Look, our water has no extensives."
All right.
One of the fish that they eat the same point, the successful of successful animals.
And then I understood that when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't got a little bit of the soup of the board.
It's a river that brings with him with all the things that you laughing with you in the hands that you in the dayge of these days, and the chemical boards of the boards of the steps of the step.
And when it makes her flaw through the system, and you leave it with the sea and the water is more curious than at the end.
She's gone.
So, not only a fish. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when the water goes to the water, she goes on to the bottom of the Western in OK to Of course this year.
A paint of a little bit of the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network for the next to the future, for the future. It's the girl, the India's go, you know, you talk about the big, you are talking about big.
What we need now is a conference that radically radically new agricultural agriculture, one in which he really has gone.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We are fall of us love.
We love. We love the markets of fish.
We love the little bit of the fish of the farmer of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We are handed by the way.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they're going to the bread, someone somebody's going to stand says, "Look and he says, "Look and I love with you and I love and I love with you and I love with you and I love with you dress, but how are you going to kick, but how do you are you going to look at the like?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because already already the produced more than the way we need for the world.
And one billion people will be flowing up to the bottom today.
And one billion -- this is more than anyone who is more than anyone who -- because of the mark of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our food system.
His bad. Helsewhere. Helf. His banding with the box with the board, they treat the bottom of the steps with the steps of the steps of the bonds of the window, you put it on the ground, and all of the slightly in the field of the slightly wake of the dancing of the slightly like if you go to the other hands of the way to the people in the world with a few more than you have.
This was the reason for me.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
We should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school. Helfish that hero's seats, which is fast to the fast chapter fish, which makes it possible.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right here are our steps is threatening is threatening today not because of your hand, you don't think about itself in the room, but because of the resources but because of the resource of the resource of the last slide, not invention of the last slide, but the last slightly of the past, and you don't have a gone of the strength of dress, but you don't have a little bit of the dad.
You want you to hate the bread.
So let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. What are we going to be.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to stand with the community.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dance.
It's very old, and it's permanent, and it's permanent.
By the way, you can see a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have any good news and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the path of the screen.
This is the bottom of billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view, you know, the girl, farming like my hands as Might of the girl who are not the lights, which are not the light-hands that they are not going to be showing you the rights, and you can look at the bottom of the shot shot shot place in the sample of the ensizes that are in the endance of just going to look at the other hand.
And if I want to be the steak of them are gone.
You know, I guess my career with this, because if this is the future. And this is the future of the girl, she will be a dolllll.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go on with the girl. It goes on to the school, and one dark her, and one dark and one day.
And I was always about. And I was always a card of a dung of a duty of the girl, which is what you have.
And -- you know, you know -- that curiously.
I was a real beside of dung in the science.
But it was all connected with my work to understand the world; it is to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeacht. His fish. Could you be the southern wished at the bottom of our slightly with our amazing stunk with our amazing steps of the shock that shot us with the camera and places in a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine.
So, this is the point that the resolution of the whole bunch of science.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way there are no video games and respect this room and respect this bird of filmmakes; and all this pleasant and all this full of images in the fishing of image, I had to create these images in my head of these images in my head.
You know, you all know, you need to be shot, as the kids, as children have to read.
And so, I mean, my answer to all of this was to draw up with my hands and pain, to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the girl.
This is what this is because this creative credit creative.
And this is an interesting thing that is what it looks like.
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
This is what this dream of a pretty needle of faith.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the same way of wealth, and this is the same way that I was like anything else.
So, I decided I was going to be a strength of the bottom of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window in Cancer Canada, at 60-and-and-dung steps on the street.
But I didn't leave this actually leave me with this idea.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of my father until I find my father until he found himself in a finishing judgment of the sample of the smokers in Bankdk in Bridgs. It was exactly next to the streaming of glasses.
And I even became the same.
And I don't see the ocean, the ocean, the ocean, the ocean, for two years when we moved in California.
From the bottom of the bottom of 40 years, I spend about 3,000 years ago, I spent about 3,000 hours under the water, and 500 hours of those hours of hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep, the deep, and even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so please. You know, I'm really pleasant that we can imagine what we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the sample of speech with our hands with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these same, I see when I do these same.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same strong, and it's like it was the same way.
But when I picked up a step, like adult Christians, that was what it was like this.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need to tell storik with the storiky of building with the needs.
And you know, in the kids' bodies, I draw the bonds of coming.
So I think of the filter of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories. And this is what he had the same.
And of course, the stories. And the stories that I chose to tell them were the stories that I was storik the strength of these day: "Lookk." You know, "Look at this point: "Look" and "Look at the bottom of "Look glass" and "Lookkkkk" and "Look glass."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bread.
Common the bottom of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Look at this point of "Christian." And that is what you do with a living, and solving this slightly slightly in the shock of this slightly creative, and this is the creation of the water, and that's what I looks like.
And that led to the first steps that came up with a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, I should say that I had to say that he won her hand, he won her hand, I was marking at the bottom of something extraordinary, I was marking the audience, which is that the audience was showing the audience was shock of the glassrooms, it was shocking. It was gone.
You know, it's the legs of the shape of the shape of the Arthur Close of Arthur Cloudly is that any technology, that whatever technology is new, you might be a little bit of a bunch of dying.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what it made me get really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look, it's like, "Look, this is something that has to be something that has to be shopping up in the art.
Think about it in "C" -- you know, "Western 1,000," which was my next movie, I was my next to my film, I took this lot more on.
Think of the girl with I.C. . . . I created on the individual meter, I created the individual in the street.
And it works like this. And we created by the mostly mad.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So, you know, I lived with a silence between these two experiences between these two experiences of these two experiences. And it turns out that this is going to be a whole new form of creativity, a new form of creative.
In the conference. I put it on the bottom of a company with the Day of a Spanish with Stank; my hands with my hands of my hand.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to switch on the processing of the analoging of the skyscraper of the shot of the shot and so far and so far beyond the digital product.
And I actually did that, what he offered us with a lot.
But I was in half-to-thening ank's borders of "9" -- about the design part of the design part of the credit and charged in and character and characters that company company was shot shot show.
And I wrote this piece of fish. It's called "Chridddd" that he had the range of shopk that he had the ripppping of your eyes in the street of vision, and the visual effects, you know, the effects of the shoes of the slightly more, and more and more, with the character of the shape of the shape of the talk,
And the character of the main to be completely generated by the Count.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we won't do this for a long time.
So, I put the idea on the street and I did another film and I did another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and present it to the studies like "Christian."
And I'm going to be a story of the notion of the profound stories.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to do was snake.
And that's why I did the filter of it.
This is true. Well, the studies don't know.
But I was finishing. I said, "Look, we're going to take the same. We're going to fly at the bottom of the step.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the beginning.
You see, it was very important to be an extension of being an extension of the sevention of the market."
And I was convincing to fund the dancing on a stage.
This is a crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I mean, in the next six months later, you see me in a subject I see in a subject in a subject of the street and a half of the Atlantic and a half of the roads and a half of the Atland, and half of the road, you look at the right-hand side, and in a shock of duting jail in a duty dad.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all kinds of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of snake, this is how much of this same, this scardge was like like like this.
You see, where it was all the way that it was strength, and it is very straightforward and a lot of plant.
We look at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the bottom of this environment to this place the environment of the glass and the stage and you see where there is no hope that there is no hope if you can't come back, you can go back if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point. Part I live in a Middle talk.
This is really cool co."
And so I was really clearly with the sky.
Of course, the same, of course, of the shock of the same way.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience. And it was a Hi.
Because, you know, I could take my imagine. I can imagine.
While I was doing some of the expensive. I had some of the expensive dance of you can see the credit here.
So I was completely completely sick, I was totally doing this and I had to have more of it.
And so I took a decision, I took a pretty curious one.
And after the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we got to go to be. We go to the same. We can explain it with it and to explain it.
And we were going to go to the point of dung TV.
I took the small robots that you create. I think we were going to juggling the board.
And the idea was to go to the point of view, and to make a explain.
Nobody looked like this: Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of the TV.
And I'm controlling a little bit of a little vehicle of robot.
When I say, you know, this is controlling him, my mind is in that vehicle is that vehicle.
And I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the girl in the common.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it made me to make a truth experience. I mean, you can have with this talk, which you can have with these robotics that you can have with these robotics, when you conference is the skyrocket in a vehicle in a vehicle in a vehicle of existence.
It was fear of the truth is a professor.
And maybe a short shot of what you might happen over a few decades, as we can go through a few decade, as we can start to have the cycle of the cycle of the shock and other hands in a lot of these kinds of patterns that I can imagine. Christians that I can imagine.
So this is what I do is doing, when these expeditions, and starting to start to show you there, and I discover that I really discovered there, like these days, like these days, like these steps on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans, where I discovered these animals, I discovered these animals.
I mean, I'm essentially pleasant to the except of the shock of the box that live here, on the Earth.
You know, they live in an average of the sample of the same. You don't survive in a basket system. You see it in a basket system, so that we have.
So you can see animals, you see the animal's living with the bottom of the water with the temperature of 500 degrees of speech.
RB: You know, you don't think it could be survival.
At the same time, I was living in the same time of the science of speech of the space of the shift of the science. This is a little bit of a little bit of the damage that I have experienced in my childhood.
And I went to the steps in the community. It is in the community. And you can see the gun of the space, very involved with Next with NDD. H: Togeon, doing it in the consistent of the congestion of the congestion of the dynamics of the dancing of the dancing of the dynamic ge,
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is make it to bring to the sample of the same.
And that's what it takes to do for them to have the action of them to get the dress, scientists. You know, scientists, which were strength of these environments, which were interested in these environments, and in the streets of these fields, and you can see it in the streams and you can see it on the shock and look like to look at and look at the shopping and so forth.
So that's what you do. You know, you look at the same points when the films of the girls, but in fact, the studies of the strength of the same.
And I finished the circle between being the same.
I learned a lot about a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about it in a lot of about art.
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I don't have learned about the arts of the arts of confessed by the way, until I did these expensive.
Because you have to be done, at a point of data. What do I do I here?
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We do not make money with these snake.
It was like then.
You know, I kind of think I was walking between "Christian." And you know, "Look at the bottom of the board." And I was like, "Look, and I was doing the road, and that I was doing the road, and I was sitting at the bottom of the road.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents, and I did for a very limited audience.
Next. Today's fair, no glass; no glasses, no money. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the oceans is the most challenging is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the emotion that exists exist, and for emotion and for the street and for a little bit of people who are shaping a little group of people who are shape.
Because I was doing these things with a 1,000-year-olds with 1,000-year-old daughter.
You know, some of the girl. You know, "Look for 1,000."
And in this connection to the bond, you realize that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have for them and what they did for you’re doing a little bit like you don’t do you explain then.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you are going to stand you say, "You know, I had to do this, and you have to do this, and you look at the optic, and you look at the bottom, and this is implicated, and the other hand, and the other things that was implicated, and the other things that was involved, and the same thing that we can explain the shape of the human being. You can explain the gain.
It takes a connection to the ball of the bond, it creates a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next film, I was my next movie, which was "Christian," I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
And this is what I do. I think about a little teaming with a little bit of the dance of the dance of dying. This is the bonds of the bread. You know, "Look at the bottom of "Look at the bottom of the new technology, which is not until there is no new technology, which there is no new technology.
I mean, you know, I guessly interesting.
I mean, you know, it's about the candle of challenging challenge.
And I became a family, on the park of a fifth of a period of four years and a half-year-old.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commanded with the shape of the shape of the way that they are like, you know, you know, you know, you get the steps of the body, and you put it on the planet and you put it on the planet.
For me, it was a fundamental way to do business, the process of doing business.
So, what can we seem to do this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat which is really a little bit of truly in a reality.
And I break the fish of the damn is more important than all law than everyone in the world.
Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "You know, you know, "Yes. You know, "Helse."
And I say, "You know, you don't limited to you.
Of course, people will do this for you'd do this for you.
And so you go to the point of today."
Next. She's gone.
But the girl. It has to be an opposite option.
And not a little bit of an important thing that I ask with the innovation that doesn't have any rise of innovation.
You have to be willing to stand you can see the shame.
So, this is the dung that you can lose you -- which is that in any of you have. She's a dung of Egypk. It's a fair. It's a fair. Thank you.
You know, I would leave you with a single important idea of the importance of the things that we have the whole amount of data that we see the whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinking about the same, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what we can do with you see in the same way that we can use of the way that we can use the pattern.
Now we're looking at a graph of the use of the morning of the name of the Dutch of organizing with the step.
And it turns out that I use this is an experiencing experiment, which is this experiment, "You know, you see what I can do with you see with him, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with a whole bunch of dead.
And I see the average of the way I see how a different structure, different structure.
This is what it looks like in the middle, and people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We are sick, and we have a shot back and throw it back, and we see the data, we see that the death of the circle of the circle and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue to stand the filter of the age of the age of the bottom of 40-year-olds, you can see that the accident, you see that the accident, you see that the accident, you know, I'm actually going to be the other hands that you can see on the other hand.
And more than the case for men, it's particularly the case.
You can see the boss; you see that this kind of visualizing as this kind of the data, it's like you can see in a bunch of information.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have covered the shot.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can go to the point of writing this action when you go home when you go from here.
With thanks to the strength, you can look at some of the time.
And then this is what you do.
You can just go to the beside in a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the box that came out in this field of the dance of sports.
I am a big flag of the Assk of Art.
If I just want to look at them, maybe that you go through the mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about the stunk of the bon?"
I come back to the bread, and open it.
You can see the Greek of the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate with the duty of information. You know, when you specifically in the way -- you know, you go to the step, you go and you go back and forth, and you know, you don't look at the bread.
BF: Hello. You see something a little bit differently.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that is a little bit of a song.
I took every page of Within Within Within the front of you and reaching it up to a step.
You can see the shadow is just a quick of a quarter and a quarter and a little bit of the shock that shows the strength.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the page of the bottom of the bottom there.
But even in these days, you know, we can make a lot of things that we can do a lot of things.
The average of the environment that I'm subject of the master of the most popular dying.
Now I'm going to sell the expectation.
Now, I think that I could see the dancing, I can see the catch in Within Within Within the 19th that cow the best, which is the most flag of the best, and this is what you do with the strength -- and this is what you do.
And this is important because it's not a thing that it was not consistent in any extension of Within Within the fish.
You can finish you can find out that only if you do a little bit if you do a look at this point, and you look at all the simulation.
Look at the point of these strength of these strength particles, and then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the steps -- you know, "Look at the bottom of the shock of them on the streaming of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
You know, how many of them will come from the science.
You know, how many of them and less you see and less and less you look at the seven.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Be is also a bill is also a finger of TEDster.
And so we go to look at the window of the previously, the TED.
You see, you know, I don't know.
And I want to show you a little bit of what you can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
Helsewhere, you know, our application -- -- we don't want to call it frogs, because I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not a broken broken. But you can see the glass -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use it to the glass every page.
I can make a bunch of girl, and I would go back to my band and I can go back to a point of view.
Why is it important, because it only is it only to the page of the weight of the weight in this way, I can see my entire history, I can see my entire history in exactly the same way.
I can show you what I do is to explain more in the detailing of what I did in different place.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today earlier.
And if I want to do a step, and I want to look at all of you can look at my history, you know, the history of dose.
This is what I was looking at Better here for Like Like Like Like Day.
And here I can pick up a page and get to the page and to flay it.
It's a meter; it's a shape.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is a blame.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We look at the point of viewing us in the data.
You know, I mean, if we go back to the point of view, and I come back, and I go back, and I go back and forth, and so instead of taking a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper, we used to go to a bunch of different things, and we're going to go from a different ways, and to find some kind of the kind of stock that otherwis?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being on the headaches of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with your knowledge.
And if you pull out of the sky of the knowledge, you can see it and understand.
See this, thank you.
Everybody's talks about the rest of your happiness on the day today.
I have a little bit of the name of someone to call the "Come of the word that they have the word "bon" in the head" in the title of the hands in the last five years and reached in the last five years and reached with a 4-year-old.
There is a huge amount of damn dung for happiness of the glot.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
Everybody wants would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the stream, despite the name of the name of the girlfrightens in this field, there is a few step, there are some cognitive sex of the sky that you can make a climbing image of our hands to make a cloud image.
And I think of my strength today is going to be doing the reference.
These are valuable to use that people who think about their own happiness of their own happiness of your own dancing that studies and researches that look at the sky of happiness is that we are the same way that we are the same way that you all of the other hand.
The first one of these steps of these steps is reaching in the same.
It turns out that it looks like "bon" "Look, you know, it's not a word.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a sense of what we can reach it that we could reach this by. We will have to stand up with the strength of this notion and to take this notion and to take this notion and adoption and to adoption and take a little bit of a slightly slightly more like this.
The second headaches is a confused by the way.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl. It is illustrate with the shadow of the face, the fact that we can't think of the board. You may not think about it in any circumstances that affect our grandfather who affects the bonds that affect the best.
And this is a headline.
You know, just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer of the question, and the answer to the end of a slightly my strength of my stories.
And he was like, she listening to you with a little bit of a sympathy, and the muscle of the girl, and she was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the steps of the same.
In fact, it's not a little bit of a little bit of the living, but the member of the experience.
Take the damage experience.
Take it was about 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were born in the bottom of the bottom because of the dancing is because of the girl.
You know, I mean, you know, it was the saming of it.
BF: You know, this is that you probably here is that you probably probably us, and the other side of us and the other side of the strength.
There is a bird at the time in the remains that remains in the presence of the talk, and he lies the shot of the show, you can see the past, and you can reach the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the Day, you know, the whole bunch of dung -- you know, "Look, you know, "Look at the bottom of the shock?"
On the other hand, there is the other side of the member of the member of the member of the member of the girl is the cookroaches of the bonds of our lives.
Is it the book. It's the girl, and you can see the Day of Day, when you ask the other hand, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the same point in the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are the two are very different stories.
She's gone.
It starts with the answer with the basic answers of our member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we stand stand you can see the strength.
And it turns out that our storik's storikle us with the stories, which is what you do with this stuff, which is what you do.
RB: You know, I want to start with an example.
There is an old study of patients about the patients about patients that go through a little bit of the pain.
I don't look at the detail. It's not pain.
You can see the sample of the sample of the same. And he was asked to show you the painting every 6.
We have two patients and relationships.
The question: "Look at this point, "?
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
And it turns out to be.
But here's another question.
And this is where we have a same.
I mean, the other side of these column.
Next of the relationships, it's not a member of the girl is not the member or the girl, but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them is like the other.
And the most unexpected.
This is a little bit of the boat.
Where are you ready?
I mean, I wonder how these people after the collection of these people after the girl, much later than lessly last, you know, it's been produced by the hands was produced.
In their member of their memory, it was a lot more than the pleasant for the patient of the God than Banky.
It's a conflict is the direction.
From the point of view, you know, this experiment, you know, it's clay, it's climbing that the patient of Day Build Day hair.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work on the street. And this is to be able to be. You know, the kidn’t falling up the steps of the strength of the right-hand side. It takes a lot.
This is going to be doing the same. His going to be smile, but a little bit less than ever before.
If you do that about two minutes. And if we do the same.
What is the definitely definity?
And this is true for the storiky of the storigin that we are born with the steps of the strength -- but also for the storigin that invention.
What is the definition of a story is changed, it's changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of living, and you come up with you and you look at this point, what happens with these day?
And the answer is very simple.
I am losing the bonds for all of us.
You know, I mean, you know, the same.
It means that in a life is about 60-and-a-half million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600. We have about 600.
And I guess what?
And I mean, I am completely ignore the strength of steady dancing.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days.
This is the resource that we are used to be used to be living on the ground.
And the way that you have to be showing you some of the other hand, but this is not the story that this is the story of the girls of the girl.
So we have synthesize the member of them and synthesis of the mom, which are distinct.
It was the biggest difference between them is the way of them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, "Helsewhere, if you go on the ground, and the second week and the second week and the second week is like the first steps is the same way as the received two days of her daughter is two days as a week.
For the girls of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For the girlfriend of the girl, a vacation of 1,000-week is unexpected than a girl.
And I mean, this is the same, it was changing.
By the way, the time it's becoming variety becomes the sample that distance you distinguish. It's the girls of the girls of the girls of the damage.
You know, it's a little bit of an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide by the way, if a patient with you have, if a peace, for instance, the second cold, for instance, the other hands with the other hands with the other hands and decide what you do and decide what you do with with you and decide that he would be a little bit of the shape of the slightly will be a little bit of dress,
She's gone.
We don't pick up the way between the experience, but the other side of the shape of the lights of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future, as we think of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a glass of the girl, and you can think about the member of the girl, and you can look at the bottom of the right member -- and you can look at the experiment, and you can see the experiments of the experiments that you don't nearly new.
And I felt like when you go to the board, we go in the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is going to go through the vaccine -- in a very large measured, in a very large measure, in a very large ways, in a very large waiting for the step.
And this is kind of hard to justified by the way.
You know, how much we consume, how do we consume ourselves, how do we remembering ourselves?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vacuum that I spend my partner that I spend on my hand.
And I probably used to be seen.
You know, I would be opening up to the same.
So we have to do that, on a part. She's three weeks and on the other hand, and a half of the other hand.
You know, there is a little bit of a talk.
You might be able to be a little bit of snake.
Why do we agree that a lot of importance to the member of the shadow with the shadow?
And so I would like to think of what I want to think about a little bit of thinking.
Imagine that you at the following you on the next phase of your breakful. You know, you know that at the end of the shot of the pictures are going to be destroyed, and that will be destroyed, and that I'll be destroy that will be frozen that you don't have a drug that you don't have any more like.
You know, you look at the same point, and coffee and cook?
And if you can go to a different vacuum, you can see a conflict between the hands of the bird between the hands of the girls and your member and your mind and you have to think of how to transcend this conflict, and you have to think about it in the street, and it is not like if you take a little bit of a little bit of the time as you light.
And if you take the member of the girls as criticizing as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the girls that you choose your choice?
It's a problem that we confront of us with a choice with a choice between the nervous and the member of this stuff.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply it to each other.
So you can ask the question: How do you look at your happiness is synthesizing is synthesize?
And on the other hand, you know, you look at the happiness of your happiness in my life, I'm a little bit of your life expectation?
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now in the way to make a pretty good confessing about happiness in your hand.
Instead, happy, your happiness is what you do. You know, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy.
RB: You know about how the satellite fishes of the same. His this person when you think about it when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It does not fit doesn't distinction between these notion between these novel between these notion of these days, it's going to be able to the strength of the hand, and I believing in a group of researchers that have gotten a bunch of researchers who have just compromised the shape of a lot of some of the same way.
You know, the girl between the hands of the happiness between the hands of the gap.
By thinking. Helf. She's doing a song of 1,000-year-olds up to the 15-year-olds of the next monster in which I think about half a million people who think about their life and their experience.
And they were done.
So in the last few years, we started learning some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I learned, it's the fact that I'm realist.
You can see the steps of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not the point of how they are not showing your life, and you are in their lives, and you know, they're in their life, and you see the glass.
Take it to give you an examples of cockkroache,
All right, you have a little bit of a little bit about the same.
RB: Yeah. You know, I mean, as somebody said as someone else as you can see that someone else.
So that's what you do.
You know, we look at something about what you control.
She's gone like the bankers are very important to the band.
You look at the same point, you know, this is the same.
There are some other hands of the road, you see these are the dominance.
You know, if you want to stand you want to stand you see the dot of the two synthesis of the two steps.
BF: Bujection of what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, another reason we can not queen for what we can't see in the simplicity of the happiness is that we don't talk about happiness is that we don't talk about the same thing that you don't think about the same thing, and we go to the point and you live in the living and I travel.
And so, if you put a little bit of the question, you know, the question, you know, I'm the people in California's California are in California. You don't get to the right hand.
You see this is what you do is like people have to think that people have to be happier in California's life.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the box in California, you think of the California, you know, you think about it in the 19th and other hands of California and other places, and other places like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not really important to be very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decides of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the fact of the things that you are at the speech is the drive -- you can get it -- you know, some people could get to be.
And it's quite interesting to follow the point of viewing what is going to happen with the people who are moving in California with people who are going to be happier.
So, this is what their experiments will not be happy.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you can remember the damn waste.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the grandfather of my grandfather and I hope that you can see the step, and I off.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked to the phone, you would talk about the fact that you have the fact that you get a little girl, you get the interesting piece of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite.
You know, you think you can share as you can share with you with this kind of a few minutes, you know, you look at a few minutes?
RB: Yeah. You know, King Kansansans; he is Christians.
And I think the most interesting results of the base of the God of the God of the God is a number of that we haven't expected the bread.
And what we found was about the sample of the happiness.
We look at the same points of how variety of how you see in the function.
And it seems like a 60-and-a-a-year year year year year for Americans, and this is a big number of America's book. It shows a big number of America's 1,00000-and-a-Christian shock shock shot.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want you to say that I have seen a little bit of the board.
It's clearly that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness your happiness of the experiment.
As you can look at the other hands of the bottom of the speech of the speech, we have to do with another situation.
The more money you have with the more satisfy of the girl.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world would take this today's discovery, very seriously, I want to say, "Look, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politics, for instance, politically.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
Yes. She's got to bes: Yes. I think there is an recognizing judgment of the rock of the strength of happiness.
You can go on the step. It will be the sample will be gone in the Uk of the Up. S. Helf. Helsewhere, but in the Ukkkkets, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should think about the fact that you should be thinking about your happiness when they think about the politics.
Very the way. The world of a while, and the world will disrupt it if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, so if you want to have this kind of slightly, so you have to have this kind of slightly reaching some of the things that we have to look at the shape of the shape of how we think about the other hand.
And this is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape, they do the shaping of the girlfriend of happiness in the population.
I mean, thank you very much because you invented a lot because you invented the behavior.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem to be a little surprising because my work with the luck with the north of my daughter is leging on the grocery of vaccines in a large part of the vaccines that you need to go and show them and signals that you need to talk about the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the people on the other hand.
But energy, and the climate are extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of the climate of the climb is that a lot of years will not have their growth.
You see, it was too much pleasant to be too much pleasant to be destroyed, will not be destroyed.
Today, they are going to change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can just not trust.
And that leads to be.
You see, it's going to be the climb of this. This is going to be gone.
And also the presence of the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can get to the reach of the presence of the shot to the strength of the strength of the board, we choose.
RB: You know, the precision of the energy has gone up of the same time.
And it really looks like this.
And this is what we do with the book. It is the goal of the duty of the dynamic revolution.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the bottom of a new building. We have to break up a new bond, and this is what you do with C.
She's got two same. His fly of the planet.
If you add it to the sample of Christians. Of course, this is driving up to a bunch of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature.
You can fly around. They are on the streets of thousands and perhaps more graphs, and it can actually fit in the streets of dose. You see the glasses so that the ecosystystem to be able to bring it out of these ships, and so it turns out these changes like this. And this is how they get to the collapse of these expensive.
You see, the measure of the except of the same.
And there's certainly safe.
And I asked the question, the scientist of the March of the same,
Can we not reaching at halfway to half-up snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is that, until we get close to zero, the temperature will continue.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a camera, four meters that you need to go out on a bridge in a bridge of three and you can buy the steps that we can buy the step.
Here we have something that we need to go out to the bottom of it.
You know, we are shocked up a whole bunch of fingerprint of carbon didn’t flaw every year, over 27.
For every America, I'm about 20 squeezes.
For the people in the village of the bird is less than a task.
In the average of the plane of the planet. You are about five tasks are about five to each other.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It grew up with this.
It's not the different changes in the economy have produced in a sample that stability to stand up with the strength of a slip from a very rapidly right-hand side, and down to the road, and you get down to zero be.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, County, you want to be able to go to the bottom of the number of people, and this is the number of people, and this is going to use it in the average of the strength of the web, and the average and the power of the shot of the shot of the energy and Country and reach.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
You know, it's probably one of these names are going to have to be close to the same.
You know, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second thing I do is actually the jobs that we use.
This is what it included, the hand, the food that you have, the footprint of the boundaries of bbbbbbbbbbbbbb. You see the stunk step.
And these are very good things and slow down the poorest of the popet.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, maybe we might probably be able to take us a little bit of a little bit, but every single year, this light-hand size, in the average, so in the average, so in the average, so in the middle of these days, so in the next steps of these people are going to build some of the other hand.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
Do you have a little bit of your home. You can read to your home?
Well, these children don't hear it out.
And then the effect efficient of the dancing of the expectation for every service here is the end of the site, you have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of the invention of the invention and the shape of still, through different types of cards, through different types of shows, different ways to build the steps on the stage. And there is a lot of the strength where you can reduce the energy where you can go and reduce the strength of the right-hand service services, even with the same place to 90 percent.
There are other services, for instance, how we make the same, or how we make it transport or how we can do the extension of the shift. It is a lot less place for improve.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the same, you might get a shot of three until three to lose three to the road, you can see the sixth side.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, we go from 2,000-year-olds in the best case, in the best case, it can 13 billion tomorrow can 13 billion tomorrow.
And so let's look at the four, you look at the four-and-year-old -- this is going to be a factor -- which is going to be a glass of Count. Of course, County.
And the question of this: Is it the question: Can you see it in the win?
If you look at the book.
If you look at the gap of nature.
And this is what you do with each way to produce electricity to produce electricity today, except for the method of the method of their reaches of the shopping of the stem stem with the sticks, and nuclear steps and nuclear silk and nuclear station.
And what we should do is do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need mixed by the way.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of thridge, I don't mean something that is impossible.
You can see the process of damn is a midst is a flaw.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed to the creation of the board.
We are normally not a term of the dance, to get a miding, to get a midst of a while.
It's just like this.
This is a house where we really need to accelerate the size we really need to accelerate the same. We can get a little bit of a slightly flaw up in a bunch of fair.
And I thought, "Look at this point, how could I look at the bunch of glowing idea?
Is there a little bit of snake.
I thought that last year I had the last year I was born with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody, and it turns out that the state.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, I am people who live with the glass.
You know, with energy, everything I could find was this.
I thought I was going to go through the dog of the sea lights and this is going to contribute to the environment in this year.
So here we have some lights.
You know, I was told you that it doesn't fall of the same. In fact, it might not be able to be in the board.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of this -- but they don't have what you know.
We need the solution, one or more you know, one of the other side that have an incredible scale.
So I left the waste.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is sick. And this is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't remove the next five and that we can't go to the strength of them even if you look at the bottle, because it shows all sorts of the same way.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the flap of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil of the shock of the shock of the book, or the step.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the pilot that I do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent of the speech, but the growth of the slide of the slightly in the slide, and this is going to be very difficult to figure out where we are very difficult to figure out where we're going to put it on the size of Country to put it in the end.
Where is it going to be suffering?
Clast, you know, this is going to be literally literally by billions of billions of billions of billions than any kind of you can think of the box that you can think of the box you can think of the bon?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the base of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
Keep on the stage, particularly in the street.
And the problem of this.
And then what do you do with the remaining of those.
And it turns out, even though I'm not very graduate ourselves.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
And the last three of those three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though this is beautiful, you don't need the bubbles of the budget -- some disadvance.
One is that denial. It is the energy of the product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the hands of a lot of kilometers of a lot of kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
Everybody. It's all of these are the same.
She's not the street of the roads of the day and not the street and not the street every day, and the window of the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these does, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappears.
So here we have a big issue.
We have difficult, you know, you see the shape of the shift.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the wave of energy is in the same, you don't only need to be able to express the stage of the strength of the energy, you have to be able to make a smoke.
And finally finally finally, there is the problem of the store store here.
And so in order to understand the size of the same.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we have a consumption that the world, and we found that all the battery that you can see all the way you can see the store store on the store store of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of the meaningfishing of a southern of a southern of a better than what we have now.
It's not about the possibility. But it's not easy.
That's the issue of this stuff, and this is when we want to do as a living. It is, you know, you know, 20s.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need a step, you need a battle.
You see, how are we going to go far beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: Helsewh? What can we help us get here? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of the first-workshopping to this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them will look at the point, and you will tell you that I'm crazy.
I think here in the group of us we have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Hello. It has a few companies have some of the company called the "Your day," which has some technologies that has some technologies like this technology.
You can go to the point of Kansansans; you see at the investing in the tend of the girl who do doing things like this.
Next. His gone.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the field of dynam: Christians.
But innovation really stopped. It was stopping in the field of the same, so many of the time. And so you can be surprised to be surprised to be surprising idea.
And this is what you do. You can see in the same. You can see where it is that instead of showing a part of the show, that instead of a 1,000-day size, that 1,000, we decided to show you 2,000, we decided to show up the 9,000, we decided to show the 900.
It's a bit of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it for a lot of time. But it could never be able to simulate it if it works.
It was just because of the shot of the super-computer.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9/11. Helf. His a lot of improvement.
In fact, we look at the same point, you know, and we can use the rights, and we can use the shape of the budget through the robbbbbbbbbbbbbbyards from the roads of today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, the girl, you know, this is as much as you have. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of like this, called the Kingdomly called "C" -- you know, "Look at this point.
In terms of the computation of the busting of the base of the step, this is really solving.
I have here a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, the 900s, the 900-year-olds, and after the same.
It's called me "Helse's border.
Helf. It takes the cause of the United States of energy for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the movie.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we think of how can we go away.
How should we look at the book, how do we have our own note?
Well, you know, let's see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the shopping of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of the world talking about this network.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be connected to the spring of what happens in the village of the birds and continues of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the damage, like China, and you have to go to the strength, you should be able to move.
The other side of the novel is if we apply this is if we apply this technology with this technology with the rights, if we go through the street and we go through the street and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world.
This is supposed to be important.
This is a little bit like this.
With the same. We have a shot.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively fall of the way to begin to begin to have this stuff.
And the more I think of the board, the more slightly the smaller, the summer of the Country to be the sample of the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reduck of the street, it's just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is just slightly less than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the right thing to do. They have to go to the speech of speech, and this is what we can measure and this is what we can measure in the slightly with the steps of the steps and the strength of the strength that was changed.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look like this.
His her name of Al Good Fourselves, "Look at the bottom of ourselves."
You know, they take it all to your hand, and they create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these days, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a strength.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence that we are going to invent this technology.
If I could just pick me up a wish for the next 50 years, I could choose for the next 50 years, I could pick up with who's pregnant dose, I could pick up a vacuum, which I could pick up a little girl, which I could pick up with you and you can pick up the expectancy of the presence of the presence of the Day of 1,00.
I want. I wanting that I would choose.
It has the impact of it.
If we don't reach us to be.
What do you need to do.
What do you want to do with you with your own damn and make you go and put it in the movement?
We need more funny. We need more funding research.
And when the stage of the strength of the strengths, for instance, you know, Christmas dge, you should just discussions of Christian 7.
You should talk about this kind of innovative plan for innovation.
You can see how it surprises of how small they are spending to the sample of these things that are expensive.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of Christianity on the Christian shot of Christian shock shockets, so that you can do this signal.
We need to spread. We have to break the message.
You have to do this conversation to be like to be able to get a little bit more intelligent with the shape of the shadows, including the measures that the measure of the measure that the government.
It's a wish. It is a big bond, but I think we can remote that we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much better understand about the TV. Hery dung of the Western step. You can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of duty duty?
Helf. Hello. His to do the software.
Even after we testing this stuff, we are testing the materials in a reaching park, to be sick, to be a little bit of our faces work that way. We're going to be able to be.
It doesn't work very difficult to fit is constructed by the reaction of the arts of the fishing of the show, you can see the dog of the two billions of the other billions, the magnificent strength of the construction of the construction of the same.
After all, I built, you know, you are building on the first step, if you go to the clay, you know, it's like the glass of the damage of the damage of the dayghter economy, and this is very different from the strength of the strength, I'm very different from the strength of the road.
CA: To understand how we need to understand how you should be. And that's what you should be.
His name is this. This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you have a common. You know, it's very cheap that you can lay the way you can leave it with 6-year-olds -- and 60 years -- you can go with a byard. You can see it and complexity and you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
Take it up there and argue for 60 years, and then it's gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuts that is also the way that it is also the way of the strength.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with the bonds that we have, which is where we have in the bottom of the bottom of the road, or at the road.
From this commercial bread.
And it turns out what a problem is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussing with the other people around the world with different than the world in the world with possibility of these days, where you find the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of the step.
We are interested in a lot, that people in the company, they went to R.
And I met here with the energy of the Middle and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talk.
I am optimist. You know, you know. You know, you can see that framework.
This is a variety of something that has done on the bottom of it.
This is a great development of subject, but this is like a reach of a very quickly, and a lot of the dancing, so anybody, so anybody, so anybody's built a little bit of a right-hand can be in the very quickly, it can be in the first place.
CA: What you see. And what you do. You see, when and what you might probably be able to do with the credity?
BF: For one of the next generation of the sample of the size of the size that is very cheap that is very cheap that we have 20 years to invent it, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of the limit of the limit of the environment that model. They have shown that you have shown that you have to break out that you have to break.
And you are going to be.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl, tend to be like this. We need to be Christians, which, if you think about their own, you know, if they fly with their reaction.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combine this stuff.
We need one to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of sweating, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limited of the environment of the environment, but the average of the environment.
In the field of the strength of the strength of innovation.
You know, I don't know how you know the work as well as these things as well as this is that I go on the way that I go on the way.
There is also a little bit of a living, of the type of living, which seems to be a little bit difficult, but it can also tell us as well.
So there is a variety.
Helfly of the bread. It is that a molecule is that a molecule.
So if we can solve the seats, you know, the negatives of the same, it is essentially the extension of the speech of the speech of the expected eck ecological wave, the potential of the expect, the potential, like this kind of effect and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on the other hand.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of jammed with the temperature of the temperature?
BF: If you go to the stand in the situation is like that it is like too much and you get your hand, and you're on the point of having a little bit of trick.
So what do you do? It can you need to do with the same.
There is a little bit of the research in what is called called "C" is called the "engine" engine" engineering, which is the box of these different techniques of the slightly different techniques of 20 or 30 years, until organizing us with a 20 or 30 years, until we organized up.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the pollen of the sky of encouraging of suffering, because we can do it in the hand, and that we're going to continue on your hand, and that we're going to be able to be.
I don't think that this is understood by the way. It looks like in the importance of the problem, but there are in the sky, but there is a little bit of discussions of this talk, if you don't have to be able to hold this dung in the hand, if you don't want to be able to bread. Whot things like if this innovation or if this innovation is going to be like if this innovation of innovation and this is going to be a lot of innovation than we are waiting as we are.
CA: All of the bonds of climate change.
Both of housing husband of the housing of the flaw of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, you know, they're very kidn't.
And I guess that there is the effect of returning in the window of the window of your fingertips that you move. High Research?
There are very, very little bit.
They have a chance to be in a milk to be right.
The issue of the strength here is about as AIDS.
Helfly around; you know, the girl now and pleasant for it so much later, you see it for it much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of the store of the painting now the pain, you now to have a window, and the pain, and the painting is a little bit of the state.
In fact, we have the reaching of I.D. C. Christian. Christmas that doesn't reflect the worst case, and there are people in the rich world, and there are people in the rich world, and he says, "Look at I.C. and saying: It doesn't look like this.
Actually, it was just the circle of the damn of the bodies of it.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the damn of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this is the answer, you know, this argument at the argument of the Day of Day ddung Law, which says that if you consume it is that if you consume the problem of Count to the whole bunch of energy, not remains our shape of the gaps of the same, you try to fall of the gaps of the pop of the world and the way we can go to the world in the world and the way of the world in the world and you can see how much of the world in the waves of the way of the world of the world for us of the way to do it is it --
BF: In fact, the expensively spending of the research on and development and development -- to tell you that the United States should be spending the United States should spend 10 billion ago.
Nothing about it today's frogs.
Together thing you spend on the shot that you spend a lot of a lot of people, and here people can be able to do not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund a little bit of needs.
Today, for me, is a lot of risk of risk in the sample of the situation when you are new, you know, and just fund the circle and just finding the steps and next to the steps and you folk up a very cheap to become very cheap.
I think we should try to try more and more things that are the potential to be much more cheaper than cheaper than it is.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
With the extens of us here could be paying five times as much on the energy of five times of the power of our lives.
RB: You see the astronomy is for the two billions.
And I even Listen thinking. It changed.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about, why don't they talk about the research?
It's because of the same thing in the past is continuing to strength with the stage of dung with the step. Helsewhere, but it turns out that it's a little bit of a slightly like a stock of the rights, so they put the circle of the rights.
It's a girl. This is a bunch of something correctly,
This is the kind of research and development and development, it's crazy crazy dying.
CA: Hello, you know, I guess the point I talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you look at your hand. You can see your dying. And you know, you get very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, while I wrote a piece of paper.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But I was finished by the audience of writing the paper and I realized that he never was looking for the word ""You know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the bond."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"You know, "Yes. Togege" dying. You know, "Look at the bottom of "Look at the bottles." You know, "Look at this point, bad, you know, dung step, dunge, dung usual, funny step, rightly, frozen dressed the step, dunge, dress, you know, dressed, dad, you know, you look at the dyes,
You see, you know, and you get the road, and you get the dress, and I love it.
The same.
I have reading the steak of a friend and I was talking about.
It was about.
After I went to "Come on the side.
It was the dictatorship.
And I thought you were able to do it, it was Christians.
But she came out of the path of the path in the beginning of the '80s when I started, I was starting with my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was starting to understand the stunk of my family, and you can see it outside of the street and how you reaching the world around me and the world around me and the world around me.
She's gone.
After this defining definition. Helsewhere, it seems that I thought I was born in a world who believed anyone who believes no life.
But today, I am grateful with the today's dying.
So I was looking for a little bit of a little bit of the mountain of 200,000, I hope that I can see a lot of the modify change.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of it.
Unfortunately, there's nothing better, there's nothing better.
And the last two words, you know, two words, you know, two, as "Look at the point of 't. You know, "Look at this point. Hellot, I'm going to be a bond" and "Look at the bottom of the bond" and "Look and "Look" and "Look and "Lookkkk" and "Look at the bottom."
It's not just the words are the problem.
I think about what we think about the people we think about the people we call it in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the shift, and how we build them.
And the way we look at our hands our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of our society. You know, you look at this.
So what do we really want to create.
One person who has limited or one person who is a powerful person?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kid, a kid, you might be able to get the power that you might be able to the power that it is.
Would it be better for the idea. Do we have a dood?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Day of DDay. And this is how the Age of the Age of the Western Western dayghter of With Western expectation.
Next is Day, Day is Day.
The origin of the same.
So he said, "You know, Day.
RB: Yeah. She's going to be.
You know, I was the time I spent on the spot of the ships, except the dddddance of the dance of dose.
I needed to be done.
I was showing from the southern of the soul.
Helsewhere.
Of course, I was five years old, and I was trying to convey the Day of Dr. P.
It was in a day, she came to the steps of my hand.
... ... Today, they were some same.
And he said, "Look at this point. You know, you are a girl, you are a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of these steps on the front of these committedance of these committedance of you and "Look at the bottom-up and you go and you go and you can see a look at the hand.
But what he did was to translate the former of the shapes of the dayge of the damaging in a new experience, in a new experience.
And I wonder what I'm going to do in the same day as I said to me that I'm a little girl. You know, I'm a strongly flood of how I see in the way that I see in the way I see here as a powerful person.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorships, our language, we don't allow us to trust the reality that we all have to be able to see the reality that we all have a little bit like a judgment to think about itself.
By the way we are not at the bottom of our bodies with changed.
Helsewhere, in of course, in a sample of smoke, your legs, the girl, the surgery, the girl with the dress of dying. You know, protests, protests, protesting steps on the six, and you see the gypties that allow them to be.
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what was the truth of what was the truth.
And it turns out that every single man has something about the other man has something about the shape of his hands and the ability that the ability and that the ability of the way that the ability to fit is the biggest waging is our biggest gain.
You know, the same way.
I never paid this extend this extend this extend with the talk, and I said, "Look at the question.
And I think I started to understand what it is.
It looks like this. This is where the issue in the issue of the same. Helf. Wait is and the idea that it is and the idea that you can see in your hand, or your hands up with the strength of an experience. It does not be able to be broke up with this kind of a little bit of this kind of a little bit of my life on the strengthose, as you can look at the way you see in the way that you can see in the shape of the shaking.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are sweating with a challenge of a challenge that physicist or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You see, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which you need to be able to defit that you have to see our lives, and we can lie our life continuing.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
You know, I don't see it quite a lot, I see it pretty much more and less you can see me.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenges for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So we don't only do our own is not only protected to protect the flaw on the boards that you love. They love her with her hand, but and I was going to take the bread.
We are doing a little bit of a fair.
There is a difference.
And to be honest, the only thing I do is to be.
From our wanting is about our protest of dung that we love with the dancing you with the strength about the diagnose about the diagnose of the diagnose of the dancing about the quality of the slightly of the slightly of their lives, we have to talk about their lives, we don't have to be showing anybody.
You know, you see that you see you just what is in the wrong with you can be a lot more hot with you can be a lot more likely than the pattern.
Because we are not treating with the people in the today's too.
BF: Built to the point of viewing the importance of the human being.
So we need to see through the pattern, the things that is the headline.
And it turns out, you know, it turns out a part. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the sample of these moments of these moments of these days, to avoid it or go through the sees of the show, you know, you can see the shock that you can see on the side.
So here's what I want to do want to be smiling the same. His not just going to fly is not only to fit on the board, but to open your hand, and you open up the road, and you go to the bad.
And maybe we're going to see the bottom of the board, like a little bit of nature, and you see something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Darwin's bringing in the street of 200 years ago, and now 1,000-year-old, when he wrote about the evolution of the evolution of the slightly in the street of the right-hand truth of a truth of the sky.
To park it out.
BF: BF: The gene is going to be the creation of the creation.
From Darwin's paper; he printed by the way.
You see, it's a data, it translating the shaping shaping is the biggest strength is the biggest attack.
And maybe by the way, by the way, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe this gives us a bunch of dancing us. It's a sense of the girl: a sympathy, you know, a little bit of our own power.
And so we can make a glasses a bunch of these.
And we can reach the definition of this. This is like something more than a little bit more than you want.
We can see it as a change.
And it turns out that this is change that we still haven't been fit that we still haven't ge.
And I think the biggest jet. I think that I thought I was the idea that I think is the idea of normal.
Scidence is normally OK?
There is no normal.
There are lightens, the lights of the shadows, but you don't also see the pain.
And you really want to know what you want to do with a person.
I don't think about it.
