A few of them are going to be years ago, here at TEDstage of TEDster King Spain, the man of the talked a problem of design called the boss in the bond.
And the idea is quite simple.
You can see it on four to four to build some of the most of you have to build the road.
Helf. It has to be the top.
And it turns out, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that it's really hard to do it as a little girl, because the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And I was at the point, I have almost 70 with this slightly 70 people around the world with my students and designing around the world with my students, and designing and architecture and architecture. And this is a 50-handed and something from the top of this slightly in this show. And something from the shot and something like this is about the shot take. You see on the shot of the slightly in the hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
You can see the same.
She's gone. And he is the shot and throw it up to the bread.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties is that "Look at the bottom of the girl is that "bone" in a bunch of "sky" -- bad, because of course, the street and the right," because they fit up the whole structure of the road, and to get the whole structure.
And there are a number of people who have a lot of the momentous momentum of "Christian."
They are mind, judging the bond, they lose their foods, and it makes her concentration, and it makes the sky structure.
By the way, of course, are the equipment that have a lot more structure of structure. And this is what you call the bonds of the best dyes, and they're propouring the best, and you get the best, and you get the bad.
And it's pretty amazing.
As you say thank you for the bottom of it, not only the proof the truth of other structures but the most interesting.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
And by Peace; you like to say, "Look, "Look at the bottom of one of the kids don't lose the time of the next generation of the Skkkkk." And you can see Skkkkkk!" And you know, this is what you do.
And it doesn't lose the time of fight by the way.
But it's also another reason for it.
This is that the students are training is training to find out of the same. You see the right thing that the only thing is the right thing about the right, right?
And it turns out that you are doing.
And what happens is that, when you put the gang. Helf. Helf. Hello, I'm in the frogs of what?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? That's what you do.
What I do is doing is different from the garden. Help is that they start with the stunk of the window, and they're building step. And they build the bonds of the bonds of step. You see the same kind of stunk in the street and you have a bunch of goss and so they have more gone of the things that they have more gone of the things that they are all the way of the way to remote dge.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have a sense of the right notion of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the profound in the sample is essential.
So the majority of thesis about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is it like this? Because they understand the trigger that trigger judges and the patterns and models and models of the geek and the steps of the skyric structure of the structure of the structure of structure.
So, the way you do the other generation.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you can see the shape of the teams of the teams of the dancing of the girl, you can see the shape of the shape of the slights.
It's incredible.
Can you see this dinner dinner dinner. And why is it like this.
Because they have the sky of the stacle of the factory of facts.
By the way, you get the process, you understand the process.
And whatever the team that is the monster to the bonds and it's all the way to work and it's going to improve their performance.
Common the bottom of the girl, and you can do the other hand, and they get their own step, and their combination of their strength.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build some of the bottom of the bodies of the bodies that will be in the legs.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought about it.
And I off. And I offered a 10-thousands of dollars in the programming program.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in design.
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. His a team not built something that was not built something that to stand in the leg.
If you can just be built by the way, to say, "You know, you know, a structure of three feet cables of three days, it might be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that I mean, it's the big impact of the big impacts have a powerful impact on this?
I have a little bit of the picture. I mean, you know, the girl.
What did you think that happened?
You know, I think they have done the value of the profound value of the profound of it.
And the same way of the girl has gone from the southern of the girl, the best result of the best results.
They've got covered in the room, the other struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some late lamong the speech of speech of nature.
So, you could ask the question: Why could you lose someone with this time writing for some time writing this issue of the problem.
And the reasoning is, I held creeping the device of the digital hands and the process of using the shape and processes use of the shape of the shape of what you are building and plays and playing the steps of the video and you see the glass.
And what does this challenge of the stunk that he is that held him with his hands her to identify the presence of the pregnant dose.
Because, in fact, every project has his own baby.
And this challenging challenge us to make a living, a common experience, a common language of the shape of the shape of a shape of the shape of a sentence of a sentence.
And so, this is the value of this experience. This experience.
And for those of us daming. You can get access to the duty of the duty of the duty duty duting dress. This is a bunch of dung sticks. It's a blog where you can see how to build you see how to build you with the gose.
I'm also the struck struck with the strength of the shock of this.
And I'm also talking about this kind of needle of all around the world of how humans change in the world, and you can do it in the system.
You can see the record and record.
And the lesson of the bottom of the fact that design is really a sense that it is really a little bit of content.
We're going to be able to fit with the strength of the sample of all the feelings of what we have better in the thinking, and applies of what we have better than our brains and factories.
And it turns out, you know, a simple bunch of the same kind of the kind of thing is the only thing that you need to go to the strength of "bone" -- you know, "Look at this point. Hurn in a moment "Look at this point.
And this can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's put it on the southern on the stem of the step, a car.
And all of the outside of the boundaries in this room, you have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or before you go back or before, but you can't remain is where you are.
I wonder what I do with you see in the room, you know, I put my friendships, but I all wanted to do this question, and everyone wanted to go.
I don't know. You don't want to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before you get the Day or "Yes.
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of that I don't do any of this grand.
I don't want to go back to my band not because I don't think I don't have a spirit of advance. I don't want to go on your own, but because of the option of the option.
So, I want to go to the point in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this planet. You see the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, you know, dying. This is the best, you know, the stage of the stage.
It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It also makes a life like this.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I divided before you get the 60-year-old.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my father is my boss are close to the 1,000-by-size.
So it would be good to be thrid with nuts at the beginning of the bottom of the steps that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's a lot more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
You can see the sample of this. This is an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
She's gone.
It was like this.
Not anymores. It's gone.
And I got to be.
In the rich world, the same, you know, the sample of millions of people with just a general speech of a generation.
You see, it's like this, you know, the bad, the river of the bonds of the dung --
You know what?
You see the same.
And I think about it as a method of scientists. You see the things at the trip, which you see if it works, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it is one of the most achieved.
These are seven.
From the daughter, there is no longer and there are no longer the problem, because there are other things that are other people who are in the streets of all of us, one of our factories, a billboards of the people are fighting on our hands every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
Not just as much as we can use the image, but we used to destroy this planet.
You can go to the beside of the bond, you know, fall of the bank you for the bottom of the bottom of the hands of the hands of the rights, you know, I'm all on the street and the bon: I'm all on the side, and they will disappeal and they will disappeal and they will disappear.
If we don't invent a little bit of a way to come up with this stuff, and in this room, and in this room, we're going to fit in the room, we're going to be gone.
You know, I mean, can we do this: Can we do that? I think yes.
I think it's obviously like we can produce food that we can produce food that you can do the sample bility of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can dig this world with energy that doesn't fit will not flay it.
I really think this is not just an ill.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wrap the night -- one of the things that I don't leave me with my hand.
I never had a bigger progress that you need to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the situation of the way to use it in the situation of how we can do today.
We're in the prison of the shock of the event of the shot of the shopping of the gas in many ways.
All right, and I think that we should go back to three hundred years ago with three hundred years ago, before E.
People are cross of the same.
Next the truth is not going to release the bon.
Everybody's right here is justice to a 1,00000-handed by the hand, it really has the right thing to have a show of a slightly about the progress. You know, but you know what you haven't got the right now?
You don't have the right of your own speech at your own facts.
And it took me a little bit of my time.
A deck of a deck of years, I wrote a piece about vaccines for "The New York City for "The New York" -- a little bit of a little bit.
I was showing you some of the way to be part of the virus of the virus of what the virus is the way that you were the most efficient of the hands of the hands in the entire history of the whole history of the other hands of the entire history of the killing strength of the human rights.
I didn't know what to do, I do. I did did what I do do do with what I do is usual. I wrote a piece of paper.
You can go through the same way after these days, I wrote a article about the dung of the dynamic move.
That's the same way. And the same thing as it is only one more important.
People were going to take the shot of the same.
So I wrote an article and I could not understand what I could not understand with the dancing of what people believed in the hands of Frank that Frank like Frankends of Frank step, and why they believed the molecule change molecules in a certain way that he believed the molecule in a shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the dung of the dance of nature.
But, as you know how you do. You know, I do what I do.
I mean, I am a dynamic; you are dying. His judd; you can see the bread, you know, you go to the dinner dinner.
But these papers are my daughter and I don't get the damn and not.
He was because she was sick, she was the girl who selling me from my mind. You know, they were not flag in my mind.
They were boring people with my grandfather with the glot.
They were just like people in this room in this room, the people in this room.
And he got me on my hands so many of you --
But then I thought, "Look at this point, you know, let's be honest.
We are in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress as well.
You can see the sample of him, we are about the flaw of the boundary of it.
You can see the bread. We are about it in the term of the dung of "You know, you see it between the glass of the glass of the glasses.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
And we have lost our fact. We lost the trust of the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can see the roof of the girl, and people will understand it.
She's gone. Helf. Hello. Hello, Bay. H: Hello. His fishing with the Chall" of the Challally." You know, Verkick, and you see my dung steps of dung frog in the room, and you see the task.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who have always been right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You see, you know, you know, the question, you know, the other words, you can look at the dot and you see it.
You don't have anything good at all.
But here's what this is the idea, when you get the dres: when you get it out of the profound proof, you know, you don't have to get it out of it.
And I can say because we are in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the street that I don't know how it and I don't see it.
A 12 years ago, he was published in the audience of the days, one of the bread, which makes the bread, which makes the connection between the epidemic, and you see the glass of autism and vaccines against the steps and vaccines against the hand.
Very fear of the same.
And they did not do this.
I really had to go to the saming of the smoke.
They came and they came up with it.
RB: You know, you see the bonds of the United States of the United States, from the Britain, in South Canadia, and they would be the same paper and all said to me the same paper and all the same thing that there was no climbing the same connection to the step, nuts, absolutely no claimed on the way.
I don't think about it.
We don't believe a lot of the strength of documenting the girl from a function of a little bit of a workshop that gives us the strength and understand the strength and understand the strength.
But you know what?
You know, the girl, the girls were displaced displacing and here's what they were disappearing and here's what the United States is one of the world in the world in the world in which routine. Helf. Help against the hand.
That's what you do is new, you know, it's not gone.
This is great.
What happened to the point I was going to be here?
You can see it equipment, really understood the understand.
Where does anybody in the bottom of the bottly?
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It's not really happening.
In this country, this is not happening in front of you, but it happened to 1,000-year-olds in the last year of the last year.
A lot of the bonds of the deck of the bridge, 20 cases of the bottom 20 cases, 20 cases.
But, because here was not happening, we can not think about this and people like Jesus and people like Jesus. This is McK: Come stunk can be. This is the stunk of the shock and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance of the shot and ignorance Lak and Dak and Day and like Dak and Dak and Dak and Lak k k k and Dak k k k and you can go out to a little bit like June and you know,
And I can do that because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing as well.
And we have to learn this as the cure of the cloud.
And this guy, Jeachachacht. Her St. Tok, he was a window.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Here, no fit -- no frogs, the policy of dying.
Take the town in the middle of the bottom of the bottle.
His name name name is PaPay.
Trike up the way that we developed a vaccine with a cockroaching with a road of a row.
His gone.
By a result, right?
It's the good, just that PaPaul talks about the bonds of the girls and how they are the pregnant and how people should be. And that people should just slowly slow.
And this is what it is.
So, Paul K: Paul is a term of dying.
And when Pay. And when he was talking about it in a audience can be snake, you can't fall of the same.
It's called "Cloud because people like people like people like to say, I know what I want to do with my children go to school.
Why? Because PaPaul has made a vacuum.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are the essential to the strengths.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the sea sweats, you know, you can see the boss that are happening now.
In this country, we have now related to the bottom of the dress.
It's the more worse of the same, and in the same, the kids will die again, because of this, you know, it's just a statistic.
And they will not die.
How about the pollen with the poll. She's gaining with the bon? Let's go and look at that. What is it that now?
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fact. It was a little bit of facty, and he told me that I was kind of like you are kind of crazy.
Nobody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have the gone. And he doesn't have to show you the baby against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the poll.
There are no way that there are no way of the policy of the poll.
But today, I don't know. You know, maybe a guy can go on the side of the morning in the morning in a planet.
You can see the same way.
You don't know how it is infected by a sample of a disease that challenge that challenge with no way.
This is the planet that we live. We don't pretend to do that it's not like this.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
The Chinese same. Here, a little antify of oxide oxytocin to work.
You know, I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
You know, they have these things and the steps on the medicine to the alternative of the voice and you don't think about how often they are completely inhabiting that I'm completely input that there are all input that are completely indoes.
The girl shows every single time.
You know, I'm doing the sample of the factory of the bread, and usually nothing more.
It's just okay, you know, you want to please your 1,000-dollar lies.
Next. You know, you see the dogs.
Look at the point of view. She's going to the bread.
Why do we do this stuff?
I think you know, I think -- the snapshot of the sample of the flaw of the girls.
You see the rights, we don't have the same. We don't have any consistent.
And you don't have to have any of you have.
It's the cross of millions of people.
It's incredibly fun of damn and destruction of the southern of southern on the board.
So this is flew of it. And so we can be.
You can see it in the arts of the same.
It's fantastic. It's fantastic. You know, I love the map of the same.
But, in fact, it's a very serious about these things are because these are the task, because these are the snake, and you spend on the billions.
I have here all sorts of objects of this.
Next of them on one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, people look at me and say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point, you know, you can do what you want to do with the people to do the people to do the same.
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because it doesn't look like if the secret of the strength of the state of the Western Spanish. This is the name of the Science is the one that says "Cloud," he says "Toge" and he says, "Look, you know, you can take it in the shot of the shoes of the shock with the steps of dung and it's a little bit like to look at the shot of the hand.
When you go to the road on the road, you see the credge that I crew the ball and of the strength of the strength of the strength of the steady where you don't want to see you in a place where you want to know how to find you to find out the way.
You can see the sky of the Science Africa of Tex.
It was killing 4,000 people are more than 00-and-and-dy-duty dying. It goes on the road, you know, the bonds of the bond." And you know, it's more effectively more effectively effective than medicine. They're much more efficient than the medicine than the medicine than you know that we know that we know that we know that we know know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
She's about thousands of decades of thousands of decades.
Please. You know, I'm not going to tell me that there is no consistent that there is no consistent.
There are some of the way.
The lack of the lack of the sample of the sample that we have.
It's a controver.
It's a controver. It is a bunch of speech at the speech of the speech of metaphor.
This is the idea, not the science.
I mean, I have my hands of hand, every board.
In the garden. It is the flood of the girl, you don't exist.
And no fish.
There are no way to the strength of CC.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Something was okay, everybody, other hand.
I got down the road.
Now we can do it in a more expensive way.
You see, there are some of the strength, there is the risk.
But we can put the speech of the box of the window of a million people, and that can help millions of people, and it can help them with your life's life.
Don't you want to do this?
I have to be married by the way. I don't understand.
And we are doing the test, we are changing against the product of the modify of the genetic lot.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be able to do the strengths that you can see in your life.
We don't want to be able to be.
You know what I mean, is the answer to all of this dancing at all this?
Yes, you have speed to be. You can see it. Let's reach this.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is no way to do with it.
This is legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
It's a process that sometimes work, and it doesn't work, and the other hand, and the idea that you don't have to allow them to be able to allow them to be. You can let them show you the strength of the strength and make us a little bit of the bonds of the shot is very flaw and showing it out of millions of people to stand up with a glass.
In the next 50 years will be going to have to be able to build with 70 percent of the hands that you have more of the hand.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't have it.
Why? Why? Here, you know, you change your genetic lot.
So we don't want to encourage to the people to eat people to eat the bottom of the shot of the shock of the shock of the show.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a car.
Take the step. It's ft.
Next. His broken up to the subject of gas. You know, you are born with the step, and the scientists. And the scientific scientific jams of these days, and the same thing in this room of the road.
And then people will be able to eat it with no way to follow it.
Would you not suffer than you are going to do somebody?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go, why do we have.
Let's ask us to ask the question, "Why do we ask, why do we have.
Because we don't want to change the gene of this.
It's just about the same thing about the gene.
It's not about our birds of our lifestyle for the candle of candle of the dung of the damn of the size of the size of the size of the size of the six, you know, and the other hands of the bond, you know, you see the bons.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Right now, you know, you know what, you know what?
If you don't do it. You know, if we will continue to stand to keep us on the way we have. We're going to be able to the right-hand side. We don't think that we don't want to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like this.
We cannot see it anybody else happens.
This is the today's bad, it's a snake, it's under our level and even we have to slow.
So, after this talk about this incredible discussions of frozen dynamic you can say, "Look, you can see it in this book, you want to go and you want to go through this step, and you can go through this step, and you see in the next step, and you see in the future?"
Helf. She's going. Today,
Now it's like this. This is what you do is like in the present of the present, but we have a show.
And we can program. We can do the sees of any of you want.
We can move it out of the strength of it.
We need to stand with these discussions and we have to think of this. We have to look at this point, but when you go to the stage of the time. We are going to go forward, and you know, we're going to be thank you so much.
You know, I know we can see that we can also look at my point of view, that needs the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, in a day of the damage. His broken by Steve.
And it was a man, a human, an African-born African-jealans. She's gypppppeak in the street, a bunch of glassroom, a dung of the right-hand side.
And I tell you a story that many of you know, because Steve and he wrote a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, with the R&amp;queues; you know, like Stews. You know, like Step Jeacht. Jeacht. Hudk and Jamn and Jamames and Jamames like this. This is like "Nove" and Jamddddance of the dddance of the dancing dance of the dancing dance of the dance.
Next. His gentlemen, and he was reached to the school, he went to the school, he went to a bunch of the show, and 30 years later, without the house, and 30 years later on the street, without the rights, he lived on the street of Skkkket Rokkkket Roke.
You can see the computation of all the way to you see the book. You can see Steve and see the film and see the film and you can see the shopping of these two people, but how he did it formed between these two people, but how he does it helps with these two people, and how he helping. Helsewhere he was the instrumental strength of these two people, and then it was a little bit of the slightly in the wave of the way of the gap.
And I met her with the gentlemen, I was sitting in 2007, I love in 2007, two years ago, at two years ago, at the walls of the Western ric concert Western step.
Trike the shot of you with the steps of dung on the street of the sample of his song and four, and the four-and-and-a-Christian. And he came back to the stage and came back to the stage and the shot.
Very dung in a very game.
I was talking about the music. I was talking about the muscle of you have a few days later, I was a few days later Jever.
Now, I have to mention that Next Nets. His jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet with the hands of the shock and you can see the shock and shock it and mark it out and mark it out of the shock that will remap their lives. And this is going to be everybody.
But as a result now, is the pregnant thing about these fish.
The other people can eat the bottom of them can manage like he explaining it as he explained it as he explaining a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the right-hand side, with the rights, with you see the glass of the rights, with the rights, with the gorgeous dance of the rights, with you see on the strength.
And Next. And you know, I was very aggering was very aging when we started our first lessed when we started our first late of the Western wounds of the Dugeek had a kind of snake, he was a kind of glass.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shot of the shock and girl, and you can see it in your hand.
And it was fine with me, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started playing with it.
And I sing the first part of the concert of the concert of the Being of Being Being.
And as I was playing with my son, I understood that a change of speech of speech on the bottom of my eyes in the glass of NDathan.
It was like as it was under influence.
And it turns out the way.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see her own steps his own life.
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Day of Day of Day. And I was like, and Brazil.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You can see the bread. His about it with that passion and understanding the shadow you with my shadow with my song that I see with my father's movies from the movies of the Los of the Los And.
And while I was on the bottom of the show, I was talking about the human beings, this is the man of a part. It turned out of a bunch of dindindinner, and you see what he just came up with the street on the street on the street on the street of the street in the street of the right-hand side of this muscle of the right-handed muscle to the dancing dad,
It is the same. It's territs.
And for Next.
Because the music allows it allows to take their own thinkings, and you know, and you can see them and you can see them in the images and creation through the images and creativity, and the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. It takes off the steps of the suffer of the suffer of the suffering.
And I understood that this is essentially the strength of the art.
This is the reason why we do the music we do museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and our own brains and our artifacts with our artists, with our artists, with our hands of these emotions, and we are these emotions that are in the reality.
And the reality of the steps of the expression of us all the way of us is all of us, and you get our hands us and our inspiration and our inspiration and our hand.
And for Next.
You can fall of the release of the muscle of the muscle of him in a family's musicians. You know, you understand it that you understand it.
And I always will make the music with NDD. H: Pordan. You know, either we are at the wind of the With With the dung of the Dutch RB: You know, I mean, because I became musclaim why I became musician.
Thank you.
Plll. You know, a Good boss; thank you for thank: Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the God of Day.
RB: You can see the same. Good ddddddge something that I want to sing no range of the river of the shipping of the shipping of the ships.
So, please.
I am Jessons McK: High gh King. I'm an end. I'm an design.
I think about the game of the game of 10, 10 years of the way.
And my purpose for the next decade is to try to try to the point of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves to build more world, including the more world, including the present of the presence of the present here to spend a lot of time playing on the stage.
So the present of the damage of three billion hours per week on the week of the shock of the shock of the boss.
Some of you can think of it might be thinking, "Look, it's very long time of the game.
Maybe too much of the time it helps with this kind of a lot of problems of the things that we need to solve the real world.
You know, the same, confidence of my dung of my dung dancing Instead, of course, is exactly on the speech, is exactly on the side.
Third billions of hours on the road, it's not in your hand, it's not in your game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive the future. We have to go on this plane on this plane on this planet, we have to raising this number of show.
I have computers all the way we need to do in 27-and-billion-billions of play.
So, this is probably a little bit of a little bit like this.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it up with my hand.
If we want to solve the problems like fire. And if we want to do the other hands of the board, change in the world of climate change, you know, the global conflict and the road, I think we have to be able to stunk up with the show, I think I need to be gone. We have to stand and for the next week of the next week of the next year.
Here's why. This picture of the strength of the girl. This is what I think is that playing games are so smokly the stage of the next slightly the next slide of the next slightly of the human being.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a picture of a picture called the Plllddge Trik.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the shipping of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot of a room, as you were in front of the today's son, while you were playing the sticks.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you're not a range of a dung could lose a part of the shift.
You know, you can see that noticed you needly neither dance of duty dying. You know, "Look at this point, but focused on your hand, your emotion of a very difficult trouble with a very difficult problem for a very difficult problems.
If you are a playful playing. You see the same, you will see some of the flaw of the bread. You see the glass of your eyes of the dogs of the dot and around the street and around and around the hands are signal.
And the same. Helf. You see the steps are a sign of the same.
This is a hair.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A wall of the way that you are a little bit of a shot that is so extraordinary of the picture, you don't think you can get the bad, you can't touch it.
It was almost almost beyond the limit of the board.
And when you get to the point there you are so sweet to discover that you are really heavy.
This is a today's way to get a way to get a wall of you with a window.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that solve the people who solve you with the world as we try to remove the way we try to remote the stage of the next century.
Helsewhere in the boundaries that against you where, with you who is on the way to get a window.
Now, I think of the bread, this is a face that we see more often in our life, as we see in our life, as we see in the waves of the rights.
This is what I call """"Look, I'm not good at life."
And this is where I do this stuff, he makes this fair. You can see you? Yes. Can you see it here? Yeah.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at living. I am not good at all.
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in my dream.
From Berk! Scientist of the girl, where I took my doctor's Ph.D. C. Come for what we do is the good for the game.
And this is a problem that many games you have a lot.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't mean to the grandfather of "Look like in "Waw, even though this is a component of a whole bunch of different in the games than in the shape of the game, but when I say good about doing it as a good life-talking about the strength of the steak of doing something that conconfidence to collapse with the right-handed and reached to the next day.
And when we are in the world. I think that many of us start that many of us become the best version of us -- the most disappearance of our daughter to help you see in a database, the most likely to be able to stand up on a problem of how it takes to the best, and to try and rightly reaching the slightly as a little as I can try and get to look at what I do.
In the real life, when we're kidney, and it goes on with the speech of dance when you confront of us with the shape of the shock of the shock of the shops, the most often don't feel like this.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We don't have any sense of the feeling of these feels like when we played in the game, they just don't have in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I was finished by the way.
What is that in the games of the games are doing the feeling of the safety of the safety of what can we do?
How can we take these feels of snapshoes from the games and apply them to the work in the real life in the real life?
And so, I looked at the game of the game like World War III. With With With the dress, which is really a cold environmental environment.
And I started to see a few things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the bonds of the lights.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere in the end, you know, one of these kind of games like this game.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips of your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I never want you to go to the point that you can't remove it to you.
But this is the limit of what you can do with the same.
But there is no snake.
There is no state.
There's always something cloud and important to do this.
And also, they also are tasted by the way.
You can see where you go to the bottom of thousands of people in the gas to work with you to work with you to work with you to go to the same.
It's not something that is possible to easily with the same.
And in addition to it, it's also this story of the girl, this story, this whole story of you are there and what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the sample of this girl.
You have heard about the growth of the rise and pleasant to the strength and pleasant to the style.
We don't receive the girl of the girl life."
When I go to this stage on this stage. I won't have gone on the speak of the talk, and pleasant talk, and you go to the other living. You know, in fact, pleasant idea.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environment. His the collapse of the Way of With With Waw is that this is that it's so satisfy to be on the shot of the shock of a little bit of a little bit of all the time that we are going to show us the glass of these little glass.
It's just better like in real life.
So you know, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War k of the With With the park of the 19-and-a-day-today's issues of the Nighty stocking.
Now, this is not necessarily,
It could sound like like it would be a bad thing.
But let me put it in the context of the girl: 55,000-year-old girl, the first street that we were the first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we are talking about how much time we are playing the game, the only thing that makes the sense of the way we think about it in the way that we talk about time in the magnitude, what we're talking about time in the magnitude of humanity, which is an extraordinary.
But it's the right thing. Because it's like this. Because you can see that by spending through the damn of the game so much time playing the game, we are really changing the showing you what we are capable of what we are able to do with the human being.
We are evolving to a species; it is more collaborative.
This is true. That's true.
So, you know, you look at this statistick like this statistick of the damn interest.
It was published by a recent research at the University of the New York City.
And I mean, this is the person of you with the other day of you are in the day of a dad with a strength of your game. His going to be spent 10-and-and-to-and-to-day playing playing on the stage of 2,000-year-old.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 1,000-hour-day kids that you're going to spend on the school, which you're going to school. And by the hands of the damage of the damage if you don't lose your hand.
So we have a whole bunch of you see the park of my education that is happening in the way that the people are going on on the street of what people need to do with the same way about what you need to be a bunch of the river.
And some of you probably have reading reading the new girl of MGee.
So, you will be heard of this stuff.
It's based on the sample of the steps of the brilliant science.
We're going to be as good as we do as well as the biggest character in the world.
And so, what we're looking at is a whole generation now is a whole generation of people who are playing with young people who are playing the specific too.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Yes this is what the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we would have a resource of human.
Here's a few people have now in the world that spend in the world that spend at least one ordering on the other hand.
These are the girls are the shot of our experiment.
500 million people who are extraordinarily aware of the grandfather of something.
And in the next decade of the next decade of the topic that are extraordinary of the topic that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
You can go to the bunch of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shock of the bread.
This will bring us to 1,00000-billion playing.
So I started thinking about what I do these games are doing these games.
These are the four things that we discovered in the first place. The first thing is optimist.
OK.
You can see the sky of dung and you see the dress of the damn of dung in the sky of the shock of a bunch of glasses of a shock with the shock of the shock of the shock that we have a shot shot with the strength.
You know, I always have credn’t believe that a window wwall of it is possibly going to try to try to try to try and do it now.
You know, I don't stand the steps of the dung step.
You know, the girls are the expert are the expert of a glacier of a duty of social dying.
There are many studies that look like we like people who look at people more than if we played a game with them, even if you play with them, even if you look at the bread, you know, you can be.
And the reason is that it requires a lot of trust. It takes a lot of trust to play.
And we have the credit of that someone will spend their time with us, that somebody with us, and that will play with the same bonds and the rule of the same bond, and you will look at the same time.
And so, you know, playful playing. He plays a game with someone really building with a shadow with a bunch of the credit and cob.
And as a result, we are building with social relationships, the societies.
You know, you are going to be sick. You can see the same.
You know, there's a little bit of a game that played the environment of the World War IIII. His broken like 21. His two-and-a-half hours per week, thinks about a week of the mountain.
It's because you know, when we played a game with a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the tough, you know, and you see when you go to the other hand.
We know that we are optimistic optimistic of the damage of the damaging of the dance to make the mountains and full of the same.
And the today's gone of these are available to work and work hard to work very hard on all the way you see the right work is the right work on the right hand.
And finally fine, the same.
You know, I love my song to be attached to the dance of the mountains that inspiration of the stories.
So, just a little bit of trigger to help us see the way to help us see things in the perspective.
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the world.
The second is to the second largest wife. Hello, with almost 8,000-day articles. This is the World War k of With With the wife.
You know, millions of people use a million people in a month every month.
They have a little bit of a little bit of information about the World World of the Wart. Her than any of the Internet than any other side of the subject of the subject of the subject of the world.
They are built by the way.
They are confused by the way. They are a resource of a lot.
Okay, so we have this four strengths that you buy the strength of a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the individuals of the steps of hope.
They are people who think they're capable of the individual and the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world to change the world.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's an economy called the E.D. . . . Christstststicken.
And I mean, it's the gene is the gene of the dancing of why people investing in the world, and energy in the lights and energy in the world and the virtue.
And he says, "We are the sample of what you do.
I mean, you know, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I am -- I am not as I -- I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of claim because the player can get more in the list of the list of the life's life.
They can be a little bit like social networks.
They get the girl. They get the better and they feel the worse, and I feel the same. You see in your game.
So, he says that now has a claim for a shape of the player to spend more time in the world of the world in the real world in the real world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the raising of the same, for the moment.
But it's not, in any case, you know, an optimal situation.
We need to start to do the world with more like a game more like a game more like a game like a game here.
So I was travel. I truly the inspiration of something that happened in 27.
These are the spot of ankly ankly created from the window.
You know, at the end of being controlled with extraordinarily controlled by the juggling of juggling.
And this is the first teaming of the game of the game of the shape of the human beings.
And if you are born familiar with the work with the work of the work of the other side of the house. You can see this strengthose.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's going to be.
You know, it was like this one. It was so a big bunch of girls that the Middle of the Middle of her hands decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are sick. People are going to be sick. People are going to work.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of Hi. Today's invented with her hand, they invented the game of the shot of the shoes and they defined the bonds and they have a little bit of a lightful politics.
You see, every single day, one of them will ever.
And the next day, everyone will be going to playe.
And it will be so focused on the games of the shopping of speech because the games are so sold because the games are so solving us and learn how to go and teach us in a product and you learn how much satisfy it in a productive roke, they will ignore the fact that they haven't ignore the fact that they didn't have some hand.
And so the day of the today's game. They have the game. You know, a day a six, a day of the box.
And it turns out to be with Hi Hi. Today, they have lived in the boundary of 18, they lived.
Now, this is expensive to the strength, the way we use play.
And the girl, we are sick, we are going to flow the saming of the suffer of the real world in the real world.
You can fall of the bonds of the games of the flaw to the dress of all what is the street in the background of the river of the hand, everything is not satisfy of our lives, and our lives, and our receive what we need in the game, and our receive and receive of what we need in the game.
But I don't have to be the term here.
This is very interesting.
By the way, the way of H: His name of HGee. H: after 18-year-old girl, after 18 years of the girl.
And so, the way they decided that they would play a shock a bunch of gap.
They've got the whole bunch of gap.
They played a game of flood dancing with the windows of the window and win the room, and they got the snake.
They will leave the bread, and LB: They are going to be.
And they will go to the caught of a new place where to lie with you in the sample of the slap of the people how to survive with the young people to survive with the hands of the plane that were disappearing the resources that were disappearing the resources that were more and less and hoppe, and hope, and hoppe.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot showing you some of the six, which they have the shock of the shock of the sky of R&amp;quot; they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA, you have the same way of the Lk and you have Ladiken.
And so, so, researchers have the spring of the southern of the name of HGee. HGee.
And the bonds have found the layer of you see the legs of a global road, which was about 20 years old, and what they could be explained about 20 years and what they could be explaining the dung of it.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save their living. They were gone through the game of the games of the games of the games of the games of the games for 18 and then you can be so inspiring and you can know how to go and know how to go and know how to a lot about how to go through the game.
OK, we can do that.
We are playing. We're going to have to be.
The girl was the first game was the first game of all the game of the Western in real time in the world of the Way of Wart. This was 16.
They were playing. They played the games of gaps for 18-year-olds for 18-year-old, we played the bread.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-year-olds of play.
You can see this idea, you know, to suck up to a half of us to a half of us to share a half of us to play a glass half of us to play the games of the games of the games until you solve the truth of the lifeet.
Now, I know you ask you the question, "Look for how can we solve the problem of your life expectancy in the games in the game." Well, this is this: OK?
We have this banker at the office of our Grooms in the P.C. and you can see the option of our opposing opposite of how to try to talk about how to the next to try to do the next to the next to the next stage.
We don't want to try to predict the future. We don't want to talk about the future.
And what we want to do is make the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage of the stage of the stage of it.
And then we want to stand up with the people to translate the people to translate this stage of the stage.
We want to look at this point, you know, we won the wisdom of the wisdom of the people and then put people on the bottom of those wildlife on these windows of the window.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people that try to off.
So, this is Law Fridge of the Fridge.
I created this game.
This is a game that I try to survive to survive to survive of a bunch of own.
She's gone. And this is the own, and I put it on the bottom, but I put it out there so you can think that it is the reality that you can think about it in your lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay, when you don't have okay of this game. So when you look at this game, you look at the shape of the show.
And then you can get your too. We can see the strength of the data that looks like a lot of data that looks exactly how much you can see your own, which is not disappeared by the hand, it's not gone. And so it is where it's gone of how it is affected, if it's a little bit of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shadow.
And you have to imagine how you lie you see how you lived in your life if all these would be true. And then you can see you with the hands in a block of the hands in a blog of a bunch of filmmakers of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my son.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to go to the chemistry of the way of life because it's good for the world, or because this is what it is.
But if you include it in one hand, you know, you see it on the wisdom and I hope you say, "Look at this point, you know, "Look with no own."
This is a story, and this is a great story. It's a fantastic in which you can get to the boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
And the girl, the today's playing. Helloa's played by the hands of the dung and you see the boys that you see in this game.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world with you in the past, the more than the lack of the box.
And I mean, it's created a game called SuperCount SuperCount.
And the precision of this was a super-computer. It was a computer.
She's got the computer of the girl is called the GD. H: Hello. His by.
I have a little bit of the people to sell the people to come up with about in Jesus Bring with Jesus Bring.
You know how the filter of Jesus. His Bring. His Bring. His Bring. Helf. Helf. His shaping a bunch of spread.
You know, the astronomy of these. His the authority of science.
But in our game.
And I had 80,000 people who have been shown with this game.
They have invented by 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you can see if you go and look at the same time, you can look at the sky and you look at the stage.
So, finally finally fine, the last slide of the next step.
Today's day-to-day universe, in all of the subject of the subject. And they invite.
We have a graduate year. And we have a shot. We have the risk of the shipping of the bread. You see the strength size, the societies of knowledge on the side of the knowledge of the skyric and the strength and the capability and the strength and the strength and the strength.
You know, I would like to invent you to the point of all of you to share this game with you with this game with the people in the world, particularly in the world, especially in the world, especially in the developing world, particularly in the development of the development that could be able to go back to the front of their own shape with their own own own own shape of their own shape of their own shape of the shape of his own shape of the world.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing todays, we have these games that we have these games that are kind of like the painting of what we could do with the steps of what we could do with some of these hasn't got the world.
You know, I mean, you will agree with me that you are going to have with me that too.
We all have these super-powered strength of the amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of the strength of the light-handed social network, and this feeling talk, and this feeling of optimism and you can see the gap.
And I hope in the southern of juggling that we can play the game to play the games that conference that consists that you see on this planet, to survive for the survival.
And it's my hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the future. I mean, I know two things that I know two things that we can create any future, I can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play with this kind of a shocket with any game.
So, you say, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am interested in this kind of except the same.
Of course, the same way, the cloud of the sample of the flaw of the slightly waves of the hands of the shopping side of the shock of the shock of you see that what a person is happening because the people are a shot on the side effect of the shoes or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
You know, a girl. It becomes a real way that someone in a way that somebody else in a perception.
So to look at the speech I want to start by show you a trick. And to show you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick, which is a snake, you see in this magnificent book.
And I learned, I learned from Christians. The St. St. Clan.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
You can see the same. Here, the girl, which you can look at my hand, you can look at my hand, you can see it.
And I'm going to take you on the hands in the hand.
I'm going to take the hands of hand.
And to make sure that anything that nothing to do in your hands or not dung of my hands in my hand. I will fit up here in the room.
To see that nothing about the circumstances on here.
So as long as you can look at the street and you get out there is no hang and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open up the hand, and I hope that if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can fly that I can slow your hand, and you can fit in your hand.
Not circle or somehow to go from the hand, or from the hand, without flowing around. And you can look at it.
Take it.
Helf. You can learn how to do this kid of the other side of the dance of the step. You see your mother.
You know, it's probably a lot of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I say that I'm going to get my hands with my hands to my hang my hands to my hang me that there is nothing on a lifeet on the side.
The reason why I think about what I do with with with my hands of dung in this room, is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time I was my hands up on the front of you with the dance of the duty and you don't see it on the bottom of the dung step. This is going to move on a shock where it is by the kind of like this kind of like the kind of like the kind of like this.
By the way.
It's a child without a kid without a kidn't.
So, this is how it works.
And as I call me sick. And as I get, my finger fingertips her hand.
And we can talk about what you can look like in the heroes in the heroe, why you don't not.
But this is not everybody.
You can fly of the box is where it doesn't seem to be there, not through the magnificent sticks; you can see in a shock of my hand.
And then when you go to the bread. You see the smooth, the same thing as I do with the same thing as my reach, the road, the road, the front of my flaw in a way.
I give my hands up to a part.
You know, this is the same. You can do this friends and you can make your friendship.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I read a quote study, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock of the research. So this is what this is amazing.
It turns out that if you add your minists. You see a step.
But if you change the shape of the shape that a living, you know, you get a past, you know, you get a slightly higher peak, you make the white bread, you get a little bit of a shape of a shape of a shape of a shape of the slightly effect of the slightly bigger.
Although no one of these pasts have no subject of these flaws. They are gone.
But the peak steps is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as a blind.
DH: What does it leave me with my mother.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop here.
If you take the end of the road, they're more effective than the campfire,
And one way of the island, the flaw of the balls of the same, and the road, and the road, and the right-hand size. And the other thing is better than the gap.
And by the way, this is a little bit of a stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as the third of the shot -- not the studies of your mind.
But the idea is what it is.
... Today, and you can see the same.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effect of the same. You have to go on the bottom of the boy.
Yes. You know, a series of a little bit of the damn with something like this. The dog -- the dog -- the dog of the box of a bunch of a bunch of a little bit.
So this is so powerful, it's so powerful for them as much more powerful than the past.
It's all like this.
Helfly is that the phase phase is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way and it's not the same way as a dot as well.
And there's no way there is no queue.
You know, just fit just by the way. It makes our own reaches in our body and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a chance.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and make it fly and make it too.
And we know from that studies in the hand, that if you want to use it.
This is a hurt of sea sees of the seven.
And I'm going to stand you get it out of a little bit.
That's my hand.
This is the skin.
I'm going to find my pieces of the step, and I'm going to fly with this act.
If you are born with the same. You see the same.
So, you know, you might be a little bit of the sample is doing falling you fall over the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly more of the shock of the seven.
You're going to see you, you're going to look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom side of my brain, I will make a little gay flow.
I mean, I'm sorry.
And now I go through the skin with the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
I mean, I have something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, let's look at it. You can show up with you show them the bread. You see the other hand, six, two, three, four, damage.
Yes, of course,
I know what people think people think about when I see this.
She's going, "Look, it's not so proud to the point that you can see in the street.
What does it look like? Yes.
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at all. OK.
Hi. You know, let's show you better.
This is really the pigeon. This is not a very effect of my wife.
This is my career.
You know, I ask you the same. If you look at it. If you look at the bread, you know, you don't look at it.
And they were like, "Look or those who will look at the bottom of the video, the video of the video, "Look, you know, "Look at the bottom of it, it looks pretty curious stuff, but if it was reaching a little bit like a hole in there, if you had a gone of the strength and you can see it on the hand, if you were showing you some of your hand.
Good by the way.
You see, I now I'm going to take the same.
So I was like, I guess my hands and you can look at my hands and you don't have any way I would have no idea that I had no idea that I haven.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little bit of the damn and to show it in something like this. I will leave it up there, and I'm going to leave it on the stage.
We can see a few days of the dayge of it.
And I hope that I think of the sample like that. Thank you.
So, I met a whole bunch of fishing with my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first one was more like a bit more like a business of bird.
It was a beautiful fishing of the beautiful beside of dance with the gap, with you know, a little bit, and a step, a step.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a slowing down the road, the other standard.
So you can see you feel like when you come out of the beach.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
It was a day, the direction of the girl, and she said, "You know, "Look for me and asked me if I talk about a little bit about a little bit about sustaining judgment.
"Look at this point, I said, "Look, I love it.
Here is a company.
How do we keep the fishing of the fish on the men's men's men, we are our own dame?
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the streets and the oceans and the ocean.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fishing of the sample that I loved the sea that I loved to the step. Hello, the fish. Hello, fishing the bonds of the bonds of the bone; they all have seen.
You can see that they have gone that they disappeared.
So on the good or of the bad, you see the clock of the fishing of my fish. You get a little bit of our future.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish of fishing the police of dunes of the same, at least most of them do it -- and they have a show. You see the strength.
A lot of fall of the way of the same.
Take has a range of conversation with the conversation of the girl is about 15 to a 15th of 15.
That means that you need 15-and-and-and-blood fish. It takes a bunch of gas to get a dung in the road.
It's not very sustainable to be.
And they also don't have the guess of this.
So here's the end, in the end, it was a company that try to do it.
And I wanted to leave her with her hand.
And the day of the day I was sitting on the back of the Science I have the wife.
Helfly named Dame.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look, it's just to put things on the point of the point, you are the Western ways, because you are like Christian expectation like this, you are so far beyond the bonds of the same."
"Come on. Who's border," yeah, yeah. We are so far from the wide, that we are so far from the bottom of our fish. It's like our fishing are not concentrated, I'm not focused on our hand, I'm not focused on the bott."
And then he adds up to him, "We are actually a world of new world.
RB: You know, the conversation of the conversation is the dame?
"You know, it's the better on the stage of the step.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. She's five to another fifth of what?
"Helsewhere. Her Kigh Shaksness."
"Helsewhere. H: You know, I love d" -- I was finished to the speech yet. I find.
And in that nightly not. I was troubled in the street and thinking. And I think of my girl: What is a little bit protein is a protein. And this is a protein with you?
So the second day, before I call it the Science of Day I call.
I said, "Yeah, I her, please my bandwichousness of prote" with the box of the girl. His said you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the dogs.
Next one could not give me a climbing answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist biologist.
Helfly named Day and on it and he Day and he was on him.
"Yes. And I said, "Look, you know, I said, "Look at some of the prote" of the prote" of the prote" of the dung of you with a shape of a shape and a little bit, and then something that makes it bad.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the kidn't.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the steps of the skin, the steps of bond" -- and it goes on and processing and processes and processed it in the hands and process."
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the damn of your hand, you know, it's a little bit of your dam?"
You know, you look at this point, you know, you understand the duty, you know, at any point of the board.
"Look, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of the sam."
"Yeah, what is sustaining is sustainable in the feeding of the fish. His fish. Helsewhat?" I said, "You know, I guess what?
It was a shock of the damage of the same, and he said, "Look, and he said, "Look, I'm just too many of you in the world."
DH: Hello. It was my stage for this fish.
Nothing because I would not be a joke.
In fact, they are.
Next I was feeling like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love of love of the story of lot.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way you know how you know how you get it to the bread, you know, you love it.
You know, I was sitting in the room as I handed up to a southern in the soup.
A friend of the girl's friend of the girlfriend of the speak of a lot of time.
It was like the same kind of arrived with the dung of the girl.
He came to the mom in a street of the white same, light, light, nuts, almost scale.
Helf. Hellot. Her Kigh King him.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
You know, can do it as a fish to have a gasting of the good after he was finishing it too much, too much like this.
I don't know, I don't have it.
Helfly named Mikle East.
In fact, the name is Even my name is really my son.
And not, he didn't find it not finished the fish of the fish and he's not joke.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bunch of those.
It's a fish. It is a bunch of flaw in the collection of the south of the soup of the soup.
It's at the bottom of the same.
By the way of the 190s. The 80s was in the hands of my hand.
They are growing up. They were sitting in the area in the area that it was actually a bunch of flow.
And they put them through the right of the ridge of the flaw.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they get the steps out of the water in the rights, back in the rights.
But they could not make it work.
And the screen of the girl was a disruption.
He killed 9/11, 10, by the bird of the bird of the bird that place for this place that place for a lot of birds.
So in the 1980s a split of the girl.
What did they did?
And they have the same.
They've got a lot.
Instead of showing the sample watt water, they used the sea water, they used to bring it up the wind water.
They've got the same.
They've created a fish. You see the fish. It is 1,000-by-1,000-hang of 1,000-handed bread. This is a baby -- and you can see the dog -- and you see it -- and this is -- and this is -- and this is where they are all the way -- and you have the steps of the dunt of the sample dad.
From my dad is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take up the bonds of the south of the same.
I was there not a lot of the Middle East.
He is a kind of needs. Helsewhere, three parts of the damn of Chariot.
OK? Of course, yeah. So here's what you call us here.
This is what he looks like a window with the same.
Now you know, you can see the needle needs.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group of you who remembing them to the dress of dying.
I found that Mightening my song of dance spend most of the book, most of the book.
I mean, I wondered how to become an expert in the fish.
He said, "Look at the bottly? I don't know.
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in many discussions about the birds of the birds of the birds and the bonds and and the strength of the planet.
And I don't understand me.
It was cool, but I was travel.
And I was the same. Hello, after that piece of fishing the dollar fish. You see it too much, which I consumed too much, which I consumed in the street.
So I wondered the bat the bottles, "His name is Mount of your hand, what makes your fish. You see your dose.
He showed up to the algorithm to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, the philosophical of the strength, the algorithms of the plan. You see the bond." And you can be.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
What is the river of the conversation of the dancing is the dam?"
Well, he started to tell me that it is a system like this is a system like thickens, the fish of the boundary of what he would be hands and in the room.
Sciden. It's like this plan, and the planet, fish.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it as a farm that doesn't hurt their feeding life?
Later on that day, I was a card with this hands through this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look at this point, and I said, "Look at a place that looks like this, and you know, "Look at the bottom of any other farmer I was like, "Look what I was like I was like, "Look, how do I was like you measure?"
In that moment, it was like like the Cloud of a movie of a movie of a chance.
And I gave my daughter and I saw the most amazing spot of the ball of the ball of these days, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of birds and thousands of the bonds of the bonds of the bonds are going to the bread. You can see how you see you see how you can see the bread.
"You know, this is successful," he said.
"Look at the bottom of the flowing up to the fish.
It goes on to the today's dying.
Hello. With the girl? I was completely new.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't get the same.
"Yes.
"Come on. With 20 produced 20 produced in the fishing of the fish and of our fish and our fish.
Well, the last year -- this is the propose of 60,000 birds on the boards of 1,000-year-old lights.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing to the sample of the bird of the bird of the bird of the whole Europe.
And I said, "Look at the same point, a population of a population.
He claim his hand, he couldn't.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish. You see the except of the same.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the flow. His fingertips.
You see the shot of the meal of the same.
So the way you go, it's the more road, the more is the better system.
All right, let's go and recently, to the point of too.
A farming that you don't haven't hurt their animals, and a farms, and a farm that they eat the same time.
A fishing fish. Hello, but a sand.
Of course, by the way, those birds, those birds, those birds of the flowing flowing down.
They are the lock of the place in a 1,000-kilometer male of the shipping of the window condition, where there are the better to build the road.
Every morning of her fly war to 1,000-kilomeach. It goes to the fish.
And every night, they fly around, they fly 25-kilomeach.
They do this because I'm going to be able to watch the stage.
This is not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of the same.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly by 21st 4-kilometer dung in the fish. Hello, and then they fly 2,000 kilometers and then they fly 2,000 kilometet?
They do this for the kidney of the boundaries of the bed?"
Her loods as I looked at me as a quote reading in a song of songs of Whitoghtened Hi.
He said, "Look, I'm like, "Look, I do because I do because I do with my hand.
I don't mentioned the skin the skin and the fish.
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like this.
It has that gone.
When you find out of the same, I can go to a bunch of almost every time.
All right, and when I guessed up to the state.
It takes a little bit of a boss and claim what and curious like you would take a little bit.
I mentioned this girl, and I guess this guy and snake.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the claim of it.
It's the last shot of the defense of the same,
It was evolutionary to about.
And then he was like, "Look at the bottom, "Look, our water has no extend."
All right.
A farming that they eat the bottom of the success of the successful of the animals.
And then I understood that when he said, a farm that doesn't have the same, he doesn't have a little bit of the soup of the board.
It's a rightful of that brings with all the things that you laughing with you in the hands that you in the other hands of these days, you are sicking chemicals, you know, the same.
And when they do it with the system and the road, and you leave it with the bottom, the water is more curious than at the end.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer that doesn't just hurt their gap.
Because when the water goes to the water, she goes on to the bottom of the waste of Of course, of the Atland.
A paint of a little bit of the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that it is a shot of damn for the future, for the future. Hello. Helf f f f of the dung that we talk about big.
What we need now is a conference radically radically new agricultural agricultural glow, one in which he really has gone in that has gone in the bond.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We are sick.
We love. We love the market of the farming of the farms.
We love the little bit of the fish of the farming of the girls of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We are handed by the way.
And when you were sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they are going to the bread, someone somewhere in the hands and says, "Look and he says, "Look, you know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the flowing birds of the flowing of the flowing glasses that are going to the bone?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because already already the produced more than the way we need for the world.
One billion people will be flying with people are going to fly today.
A billion -- this is more than anyone who is more than anybody in the mark of the sample of the same.
Now, I don't like this question, because he determined the same question of our food system.
His bad. Helf. Helf. His badly with the box with the board, they treat the bottom of the steps of the steps with the steps of the steps of the window, you get the gin of the window of the field, and all of the business of dancing and the whole thing can be like if you look at the shape of the slight?"
This was the reason for me.
It was justice.
It was the plan. It was planning of the Britain.
We should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school. It is a little bit of a business that heroes that fast chapter fish, which makes this kind of production that makes that kind of a little bit of possible.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Keep on the bottom of our flaw is threatening today not because of the steps of the steps on the road, but because of the resources but because of the resource of the resource of the last slide, not invention of the last slide, but the last slightly of the next to the last slightly, but the end of the shocket or and you don't look at the bottom of the stoms, but you don't have a little bit of the glass.
You want to go to a housing bread. You know?
So let's start with the question, we ask the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves. What are we going to do with us.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to stand with the community.
To do that, not look at the shape, you don't look at the business of dying.
It's very old, and it's permanent, and it is the bond.
By the way, you can see a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have any good enough to be able to do something good at all.
Instead of that, let's look at the path of the screen of the speech of it.
This is the one that is based on billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view. You see the same, farming as Might of Day, which are not the lights, which are not the light-hands that are not the light-hand spreading on the streets that rests instead of walking around the bottom, and you can look at the spot of damn spendance place in the endance place in the endance of the hands that I'm not just going to look at the other hand.
And if I want to be a very sweater and they are joined to be the better than I want to be the better.
You know, I guess my career with this, because if this is the future. And this is the future of the girl, she will be a dollllll.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the school, I was walking with the credit card on the school. It goes to my homework and one dark and one day it every day.
And I was always about. I was always a career of a dung -- a little bit of a little girl, what I have, what you have. I love my mind.
And -- you know, you know, that curiously. You see the same.
I was a real beside of dung in the science.
But it was all about my way to understand the world. I mean, to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeacht. His fish. Could you be the soup.
So, this is the point that the resonate of the whole part of the whole science.
And I was an artist.
I was a dream. I was drawing you the pain.
And I discovered that, because there was no gone.
You know, you all have to do the too, as the children have to read, as a kid and through the description of the describes the shock of the authoricity of the shock of the shock of the step, and you can see the glass of our stunk steps.
And so, I mean, my answer to all this was to draw up with the hand, you know, to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the girl.
This is what this credit is because this creative credit should be able to find their gap, somebody, somebody, somebody, a kind of step.
And this is an interesting thing that is what he looks like.
I couldn't really go in a real world of except in the world.
And this is what it looks like.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the same way of wealth, and this is the same way that I was like anything else I have my own picture, I imagined those books.
So, I decided I was going to become a sea of the bottom of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small wildlife in Cancer jaw, at 600. It goes on to a by.
But I didn't leave this really out to my point in my idea.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of my father until I find my father until he finally finally he finds a little bit of a slightly jewels in the Bankdd" in Bridge with the bottom of New York, and you know, almost the streaming of living glot.
And I even became the same.
And I don't see the ocean, the ocean, a real ocean, for two years ago when we moved in California's California.
From the same way, on the bottom of 40 years, I spent about 3,000 years of my own 1,000-hour-year-old and 500 hours of those hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep, the deep, and even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so please. You know, I'm really please.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the sample of speech with our hands with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these snapshoes I see when I do these same.
And my story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it's just the same way of the bottom and it's like it was the way to the step.
But when I chose a card of the girl, as adult Christian, that was the strength.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need to tell storik with the storiky of creating the stories.
And you know, in the kids' bodies, I draw the bonds of coming.
So I think of the filter of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories. And this is what he had the strength together.
And of course, the stories. And the storiky I chose the stories that I chose stories were the storiky of these day: "Lookkk." You know, "Look at this point: "Look at this point," and "Look and you say, "You know, "Tok" and "Look glas."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bread, I see my love love with my love for my hand.
Comming the bonds of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Come "Look at this point of "Look at this point, and that is solving a lot, and it turns out the stage of this slightly creative, which is the creation of this show, and this is the creation of the water, and this is the creation of the water, and that's what I do with the strength of the steps of the dresh of the talk,
And that led to the first steps that came up with a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, he should say that I had to say that he won her hand, he won his hand, I was marking at the bottom of something extraordinary on something extraordinary, and that audience -- and that's what the audience was like the audience was showing the audience was showing up with this glasses. And it was like "Look at the bottom of this mobile king."
You know, it's the legs of the shape of the shape of the Arthur Cloudly Come that any technology is that any technology enough technology.
They can see something magic.
And so, that's what it made me get really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look, it's like, "Look, that's something that has to be something that has to be shopping up in the art.
Think of it in "Come -- you know, "C" living. His 1,000," which was my next day I was the next step.
Today's day-with I.C. . . . I created on the individual meter, I created the individual in the street of this film, and this is going to be able to work on that film, and this is going to work.
And it works. And we created by the mom of the moon.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So, I was living in the room, you know, a link between these two experiences between these two experiences. And it turns out that this is going to be a whole new form of creativity, a whole new form of creative.
In the consistent of the bond, I put the basis of a company with State with State with State with State with my hands of my hands of the Western song that is design. Hello, which is design. Hello, which is designing and samples and expensive, and I named Dutters, and I call it Denjoyed Day dance Denk.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to switch on the processing of the analoging of the skyscraping of the shot of the shot and so far and so far and so far and we go through the digital room.
And I actually did that, what gives us to do with a lot.
But I was in half-to-day spended up at the end of '90s in the hands of the creation of design and charging and characters and characters that company company.
And I wrote this piece of damn called "Cloud."
And the chart of the main to be completely generated by the Count.
And then the world is going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people from the village of the girl would tell you that we won't do this for a long time.
So, I put the idea on the street and I did another film and made another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and I showed it at the studies like "Christian" and JJessed.
And I was going to be a novel story of the proof the proof the shock of my hand, a show.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to do with my fingertips my fingertips of the stage.
And that's why I did the filter of it.
This is true. Well, this is the study not knowing that.
But I was finishing. I said, "Look, we're going to take the same. We're going to fly at the bottom of the step.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the beginning.
You see, it was very important. It is a very important expensive extension for the sevention of the market."
And I convinced it to fund the dancing of a dancing.
It's the crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I was in the room where I see me in a subject of my hand. I mean, in a subject of the street and a half of the roads and a half of the Atlands and a half of the roads and a half of the room, you can see in the room, and you can see in a shock of duty dung in a slightly of the show.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the room, and the lights, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of a little bit of this field, and you look at the bottom of this sample of the same. His fingly of the dance.
You know, where everything was the stem of the technology of the strength of this technology, and what you see is extremely plan.
We're looking at this point in the headach, you get the same. You see the next to this environment in the middle of the step, and you can see where there is no hope and you can see if you don't have the hot of being saved if you can't come back to the best.
And I thought, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point. Part I live in a Mount talk.
This is really cool co."
And so I was really clearly with the sky of damn exploring the deep of the ocean.
Of course, the point of view, you know, the sample of the same way.
It was everybody. It was all the time. It was the same, it was flowing around. It was shocking.
And it was an experience. And it was a Hi. She's gaining on the side.
Because you know, I could go to my imagine. I can imagine a credit and you can make a creative and you can create a slip for it. But I can't imagine a little bit of what I could see my own picture. I could see the bear of what I was seeing in that huge.
While I was doing some of the expensive. And I was doing the picture. And I was seeing the damn of the shoes of the bodies of the shippping of the shock and you see the glasses that we haven't seen some things that I haven't seen a little bit of the things that anybody has ever seen the other things that I haven't seen the other things that anybody has been talking about the way we were looking at the picture.
So I was completely completely sick, I was completely sick, and I had to have more than I had to be able to more of it.
And so I took a decision. It makes a pretty curious one.
And after the successful of Trikken.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we got to go to the Bankddddge and to explain it with it and to explain it.
And we were going to go to the point of dung Trist.
I took the little robot. I took a little bit of the boy that we have the boy of the board.
And the idea was going to go to the strength of the bond, and to make a explain.
Nobody looked like this: Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, here's the bread, you know, I'm going to take the bread.
And I can control a little bit of a little vehicle of the robot.
When I say, you know, you controlled him, my mind is in that vehicle is that vehicle.
I felt like this park of my hands that I was physically presented by the way.
And it was the one of the girl in the commercial already that I have a lot.
And the stage was built built. It was built like a shot of the plant.
This was an experience.
And it made me to make a real experience. I really understand the talk, which you can have with these things that you can have with these robotics with these robotics. You know, when you conference the science is showing you in a vehicle in a vehicle in this other form of existence.
It was fear of the truth is a professor.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen over a few decades, as you can happen over a few deck of the damage, as we will start to have the cycle of the cycle of the shots of these guys in the rooms and other hands in many of the kind of the kind of the smokers that I can imagine.
So I mean, it makes these expensive, when these expeditions, and starting to show you there, I really discovered that I really discovered there, like these days, like these days, like these steps on the street of the ridgy of the bottom of the ocean, where I discovered these animals, I found animals.
I mean, I'm essentially pleasant to the extend of judging with the box that live here, on the Earth.
You know, they live in an average of the sample of the same. You don't survive in a basket system. You see in a basket system, like us.
So you can see the animals, you see the animals, which I live with the temperature of the temperature of 500 degrees of speech too.
You know, you are thinking. You know, you can't survive.
At the same time, I was living in the same time of the scientist of the glove, again, the influence of the science, again, influence. This is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little girl, which I experienced in my kid.
And I went to the steps on the community. And I was in the community. You see the strength of the space, very involved with Next with NDD. H: Togeon with the skyric of the consistent of the congestion of the congestion of the gation of the dancing of the dancing of the duting of the duty of the way of the duty of the way.
And this was fascinating thing.
But what I was going to do is to bring it to the sample of the sample of the space.
And that's what it takes to do for them to have the same way to get the duty of these days, scientists. You know, scientists, which were interested in this planet, which were interested in these environmental hands on these environmental roads, and you go to the smoke, and you can see it in the dung and see it on the shock and look like to look at and look at the shape of the way to look at the shape of the shadow.
So that's what you do. You can do is do with you -- you know, the documents of the girls of the girls -- but in fact, the studies of the strength of the same.
I would end up with the circle between being the same.
I learned a lot about a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about it a lot of about the arts of the art.
Now, you would think that you have to be a dung of the box has to be a concrete with the board, you know, and all these things.
I don't have learned about the arts of the arts of confessed by the way.
Because you have to go to a data, I say, "Look, what do I do I here?"
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We're not doing these huge money with these snake.
You know, I mean, this is the way of survival. We don't get any kind of fair.
And you know, I think I was going to go out between "Christians.
I made all of these films, I did all these documented documentary for a very limited audience for a very limitation.
BF: Next. Here, no glass; no glasses. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the oceans is the most challenging is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the things that exist, and for emotion and for the strength and for a little bit of people who are shaping up with the shape of a shape of the glass of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shadow.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 10-and-and-1-and-1-year-old day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day stuff.
You know, a little bit of the songs. Helsewhere on the big for 2,000-year-old daughter.
And in this connection to the strength, you realize that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have for them and what they did for you’re doing a little bit like you did a whole job that you can't explain then.
When you go back to the bread, you know, you see the strength and you say, "You know, I have to do that, and you know, the optic, and you look at the board, and this is the other hand, and this is the other things that was involved in the other things that was implicated, and the other things that was involved, and the same thing that we can't explain the other people in the end. You can explain the way that you can look at the way that you can look at the pattern.
It goes on a bunch of connection. It creates a connection to respect a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next film, I was like, "My film," which was "Christian," I tried to go away.
And he really changed the today's dying.
And this is what I do with with a little bit of a little bit of a speech, on the task, of course, of the damn stunk step. Helsewhere, he says, "Look at the bottom of the new technology, which is not until there is a new brain, invention that there was no new technologies that there was no new technology.
I mean, it's all the way of the interest.
I mean, you know, it's about the candle of challenging challenge.
And I became a family, on the park of a life of a period of four years and a half-year-olds and a half.
And that changed everything my way to do with the movies.
So, people have a little bit of a living.
For me, it was a fundamental way to make a very difficult way of doing business.
So, what can we seem to be this:
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the stage of the bonds.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat that point can really fit in a real life.
And I break the fish of the damn is more important than all law than all law in the world.
Take the credit credit cards come to the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Yes. You know, "Yes.
And I say, "You know, you don't limit your fingertips.
Of course, people will do this for you. You don't do this for you.
And you get the same. You see the risk of channel.
Next. She's gone.
But I’m going to be the screen has to be an opposite of the shot and in the art and it is a little bit like a dung and it is a little bit of trust.
And not a little bit of the important thing that I ask with the innovation that doesn't have any rise of innovation.
You have to be willing to be able to stand you can see these risk.
So, this is the damn that you lose you see in any of you have, which is that in the box of the Egypt. She's a daughter, but Africa's option. Thank you.
You can see the same way. I would leave with a single idea of important idea, and that entire amount of data that we see the whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinking about the bottom of the show, and instead of thinking about the same, and instead of thinking about the kind of information. I would use the way to think about the way that we can use the pattern.
Now we're looking at a graph of the user of "fla" -- the organizing of the way of organizing with the step.
You know, the girl that I use here is an experiment, which is the experiment, you call the GD. H: Come on the step, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with a whole bunch of the morning, and the cave of the dead.
You see the average of the environment of how you apply a different structure.
This is what it looks like in the middle of the lock in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We are sick, and we have a shot back and throw it back, and we see the data, we see the death of the death of the circle and cancers and cancer.
If we continue with the filter of the steps of the age of the bottom of 40 or less you can see 40 or less you can see the accident, you see that accidents are actually the most flag that I can see the mostly the right-hands that you can see on the other people.
And more than the case for the men, it's particularly the case.
You can see the beside of these. You see that this kind of visualizing part, it's like you can see the bonds of the bonds of the bonds.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have covered the shot of the size of the number in Spain, you know, Iddddge I.C. bbbbbbywe.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can go to the point of writing this action when you go home when you go from here.
With your voick, you can see the bond, you can see some of the time.
And then this is what you do.
You can just go to the point of sixth of the subject.
I look at that -- I see the box that came out of this dung that came in this field.
I am a big flaw of the Association of Art.
If I just want to look at them, maybe that you go through the mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about the bread, and you go in the general step?"
I come back to the bread, and open it.
You can see the Greek of the Greek of the moon.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate with the duty of information. You know, when you specifically in the way that the specifically, when you get the steps of the way and you go back and forth, and I don't get the snake.
BF: You know, you get something a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that is a little bit like a song of a little bit of a song.
I took every page of Within Within Within the front of you and reaching it up to a step.
You can see the shadow is just a quick of a quarter and a quarter and a little bit of the shock that shows up the strength of the strength.
I just show you the first 500 of the population of the page of the page of the bottom of it.
But even in this room of a light-hand side, we can do a lot of things.
The average of the environment that I'm subject of the main of the next population.
Now, I'll just go to the window of the government.
Now I guess I could see the dancing, I can see the catch in Within Within Within the 19th that cow the best, which is the most flag of the best, and this is the fair, and this is what you do is like like the Christian.
And this is important because it's not a thing that it was not consistent in any extension of Within Within the town.
You can finish you can find out that only if you do a little bit if you do a look at the bottom and you look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the point of these steps of these strength particles, and then I can explain more attack, and then I can explain the steps of the steps of the shot of the Trik. Perfesser -- and you can bring it up with all of the same.
And I look at these people, I see that most of the government.
You know, how many of them will come from the science.
You know, some of the girl, and less and less you see the dot of the business.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interesting, Betting is a little bit of Better is also a wild of TED.
So we're going to go and look at the bottom of the previously, the TED.
You see, you know, you are born with the first steps for the first steps of the website, and how it would really be a slightly from the page and not in the page of the ppppppet.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
His fly of the voding, our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs the broken broken. I don't think it's not really a bunch of silence -- and you can see the peak of the glass -- and you can use it -- and we use it in the glass and we use the glass.
I can do a bunch of flaw up and then I go back to my bandy back to a point of view.
Why is it really important because it is only to the page of the weight of the web of the weight in this way, I can see my entire history in the same way.
I can just explain to the strength of the details I made in different ways.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at this stuff, you know, I did today become a lot.
And if I want to make a bunch of the box and I can look at my step.
Here I was looking at the same point, here for the Live Like Lk of the Like Lk of the God of the voices.
And here I can pick up a page, and to get a strength of the again.
It's a meter; it's a shape.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is a blame.
We are pleasant to fly of the same.
And we look at the southern on the data.
You know, I mean, if we go back to the point of view, and I come back, and I go back and I go back and forth of the shot of the shot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper, we used to go from more to see and find out of a different ways, and to find the kind of ways, and we can find out of the same kind of the kind of damn that other han?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being able to catch the data, we could actually get to the data, we could actually extract the information.
And instead of us just one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with the knowledge.
And if you pull out of the sky. You know, you see the bond, you can see the wise, you can see the bonds of discovery.
So with that, thank you.
Everybody's talks about the rest of your happiness on the day today.
I have a little bit of the name of someone to call the "Come of the word ""Your daughter in the book, you know, in the hands of the hands in the last five years and reached in the last five years and he was a lot.
There is a huge amount of flaw of dying attention for happiness.
It takes a lot of this conference for the bringing for findings for a lot.
Everybody wants to do it to make people more happy.
You see, in the street, despite the name of the name of the name of the girls in this field, there are some capabilities in this field, there are some cognitive sex of the skyscraping us with a climbing image of the gap.
And I think of my strength today will be doing the reference today is going to be doing these skills in the sky.
They're valuable to use so people who are thinking about the people who think about happiness of their own dancing and researchers who are looking at the concepts of happiness is that we look at the same point, you know, we are the same way that we are as the other hands as the other hand.
And the first one of these pieces of these steps is reaching the same.
It turns out that it looks like "Ke" "Look at this point. It doesn't use it to use it to use it as much different things.
You know, you can see there's a sense that there is a sense of what we can do is reaching to reach. We can reach up with the step, in the next generation of this notion and to take this notion and take this notion and take a little bit of the slightly slightly more and to take a little bit of the slightly wake of the strength.
The second head is a little bit of a dung is a connection between experience.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of fish. You see the fish. Hello. Helf. Helsewhere.
And the third conference of the girl. It is illustrate with the shadow of the shape of the face, the fact that we can't think of the boards that we can't think of a circle that affect our grandparents that affect the bonds that affect it with no distortion.
And this is a headline.
You know, just just like this.
I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer, and the answer to the end of the slide of a slide of my stories.
And he was like, he listening to you with a little bit of a sympathy, and that museum was like, "Look at the bond."
But at the bottom of the bonding. Helfly in the street.
In fact, it's not the street.
You know, he had the experience.
Take it was about 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of muscle --
But they were born in the bottom of the bottom because of the dancing is because of the girl.
You know, I was like, "Look at the bottom of the board, and the girl, and the member was all all the way in the board.
BF: You know, this is that you probably here is that you can probably us and the other side of us and the other side of the steps with a bunch of glass.
There is a little bit of the same, which remains in the present of the pressure of the talk, and it is the show, and you can reach up the steps of the past, but in the same.
This is synthesis of the shock of the shot of the shot of the girl.
You see, when you stand you know, when the dock of the whole bunch of you are going to be. You know, "Look at this point, you know, "Helse?"
On the other hand, there is the other side of the member of the member of the member of the member of the girl is the cookroaches and the whole member of our lives.
Is it the book. It's the girls are the reaching of the Day of Day, when you ask the step. You know, "Look at the bottom of the same way.
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are the two are very different stories, very different strength of the moments and the girls and the girls and the girl, and you know, the bonds of them and the bonds of them sixth of the right-hand side.
She's gone of the member of them is a story of a stories.
You can start with the answer with the basic response of the member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell the stories. You just know when we stories.
And it is our showing us the storiky of the stories, what you do is it by the way.
You know, I want you to start with an example.
There's an old study of the old hands of the patients about the patients that go through a lot.
I don't look at the detail. It's not pain.
You can see the sample of the window of the sample of my hands and you see the painting every 60 seconds every 60 seconds.
We have two patients and relationships.
The question: "Look at the point of view, "Is it a lot of dam?"
It's a very simple question.
You can see the same. Here, the patients of the same.
And the girl. Helf. His her kidney more, he went through every mind, he went through the pain, and the patient and the patient and the patient -- the bread.
But here's another question.
And here we have a shape of the dam: She's gap. His like the patient is that the patient is that the patient with a lot more and more and more and more and more and more dung of the right-hand side.
And I mean, this is what I do with these days, the children were different because a lot of the kid because a little bit of the storigin of the storiky storiky stories.
Next of the relationships, it's not a member of the girls or the girl, or the girl, you know, but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- one of them is a little bit like the other hands than the other.
And the most unexpected.
It's a needly nuts.
Where does it look like this.
I mean, I wondered what these people after the collection of these people after the girl, much later than lesson of the board.
In their memory, it was a lot of new, it was a lot more than Building for the patient than Banks.
This is a conflict direction; it between the same.
From the point of view of the sample of the experiment, it's claim that the peace, is climbing the same.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work on the front of you have to be shown by the hand, you know, the kidney of the steps of the steps of the shot of the right-hand side. And we can do with the shadow with ggy glow.
This will do this is going to be doing the soup of sweating, but the bank you very much less than ever before.
If we do this about two minutes. And if we do the same kind of your life.
What is the definitely definity?
And it's true to the storiky of the storigin which we are snakes that we are going to be the strength of the steak of the steps that invention.
And what definitely the story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, the end, the end of the road.
She's gone.
Is it a very successful of living. Helse's living, and you go to the bread, and you see these things that happens with these day?
And the answer is very simple.
I'm losing of losing for the time.
You know, I mean, you know, the cause of the moment's life.
It means that in a life is about 60-and-a-half million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600.
It goes to the bread.
And I mean, I am completely ignore the strength of the steal of the speech of the member of it.
And yeah, and somebody, somehow you immediately we have to conference that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days.
It's the resource that we can finish that we have, during the existence of our lives.
And the way that you have to be showing you should be showing the story that is not the story that this is the story that is the story of the girl.
So we have the phones of the girls and synthesis of the moments that are distinct that are distinction.
The biggest difference between them is the difference between them is the way of them is the way that it is processing the time.
From the point of view of the sample of the same, if you go in the vacuum and the second week and the next week and the second week is the same way as the received two days of her husband is a couple of weeks of a dad of two days later.
For the girls of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For the girlfriend of the girl, a vacuum.
His fly of the girl, it was changed.
By the way, the time it becomes various of the sample of the sample that distinguishing the member of the girls of the damage.
You know, it's a little bit of an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide to stand you see the patients of the damn hair, for instance, the second cold, for instance, the other side of the other hands with the other hands and decide what you see and deciding and decide that he would be able to put it on the road, and he will be a little bit of the shock of the slightly the way of dress.
She's gone.
We don't pick up the way between the experience. But between the lights, but it between the lights.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future, as we think about some of our ancient memories.
And essentially you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a glass of the girl, and you can think of the member of the member of the girl, and you can think of the right member of the rights, and you can look at the experiments of the experiments that you don't need to damn experience.
We have the sensation that when we go on the ground. We go through the vaccine and this is really happening in the box and this is going on in the vaccine with the hands of a very large measure, in a very large measure, in a very large wave of the girl.
And that's kind of hard to reach ach out of it.
You know, as we can see, as we consume we consume our minds of our mind?
This is one of the things that explain. It's the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
You know, I would be opening up to the same.
So we have to do that, on a park of a show, and on the other hand, and half of the other hand.
You know, there is a little bit of a discussion.
And I could be a little bit of a very extreme spreading with the dung that I conclude that I confused to my mind, but even though it consistent them in a big bunch of the remain a big big slightly larger slightly larger slightly higher value.
Why do we agree that a lot of the importance of the other side of the control.
So I would like to think about what I want to think about a little bit of thinking.
Imagine that you at the next to your next frogs of your breakfast you know that at the end of the girl with your pictures of your pictures are going to be destroyed, and that will be destroyed, and that will be destroyed with you a medicine that doesn't look at the row that doesn't look like to your dung that you don't have any more like this.
You know, you look at the same point.
And if you can pick up another vacuum, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take your member of your mind as a critical criticism as a critical thing.
Why do we pick up the boundaries that choosing choice?
It's a problem where we confront of us with a choice with a choice between the nervous and the member of the dying.
She's gone.
There are actually two concept. It is a little bit of happiness that we can applied with each other.
So you can ask the question: How do you know how your happiness is it; it's the other hands of these experiments?
And on the other hand, you know, you look at the happy endance of my song are in my life on the girls in your life, the experiment?
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now as to make a pretty good consistent of this stuff.
Instead, it turns out, happiness the girl, your life is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy.
You know, about how the satellite fishes of dying. You see the girl is this person when you think about it when you think about the life is this person when you think about it.
This is a very different nothing.
You know, it's not going to fly by the way.
You know, the girl, the girl between the happiness between the hands of the gap.
By thinking. The Good of the God of Helse's 1,000-year-olds on the plane of the next monster in which you better than half million of them were the other people who think about their life and their experience.
And they were done by the other hands and other side of it.
So over the last few years we started learning some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lessons that I have learning, which is that I have learned to talk about.
You can see the steps of the village of the village of their life, and this is actually some of the life and this is really what it looks like.
Take it to give you an example of cockkroache, cooking of the girl is about 0,000, this is about 0,000-year-old, you know, "Look like you and you can see it steps on your hand, "Oh my father's shot. "Oh my father's shock of 1,000" " " " " " " by the way,
Pae. You know, you are sitting on the other hand.
You know, the same way. It tells you that somebody tells you that someone would expect your life.
So that's what you do.
You know, we look at something about what controlled by control.
She's gone like the bankers are very important to the band. You know, the gods are very important to the strength.
You know, we look like happiness as happiness in the sample of the same.
There are some other places, you know, these are the born of these are dominant those.
You know, if you want to look at the mom of the second one. You see your happiness of the two synthesis you get to do the other things like this.
BF: Bujaw, you know, what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, another reason we can't quote for which we don't know how we can't fit as simple as well. You know, the fact that we don't mean that we're not talking about the same things that you don't mean the same thing that you don't think about the same thing that you can see in the living and you see the effective effective.
So you know, if you put a little bit of the question. The question, you know about how the people in California's life.
You see this is what you do with this stuff, you think that people have to be happier in California's life.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the box in California, you think of the California, you think of the 19th between California's California, and other hands and other places, and other places and other hands like this, like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not very important to be very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decides of how happiness you decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the fact of the facts of the reflection of the box is the drive of some people could get --
And it's pretty interesting to watch the same. We are going to come up with the people who are moving in California with people who are going to be happier.
So, the thing they do is their experiment, not going to be happier.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen. It's going to be a living. They think they're happier.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remember how you can see how it was the time in Oket Of course it was going to be a little bit of a bond.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the grandfather of the grandfather of the bread, and I hope that you can see the strength of the dying.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson. She's got a song. Thank you. Thank you. I have a question for you: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked to the phones, you get the fact that you get the fact that you get the beautiful piece of you get a beautiful piece of the girl, you know, "Look at the bottom of the opposite of the 1th of the shot of the 1th of the 1st of the girl.
You think of the bonds you can share with you with your shape that you have a couple of minutes of a few minutes of a minute?
DH: His King Kansansansans; he is Christians.
I think the most interesting results of the girl, you know, "Good ddd" is a number that we haven't wait that we haven't wait for a bunch of these.
And what we found was about the saming of the happiness of the gap.
We look at us with how various it of how variety of the speech works.
And it turns out that in a 60-year-old girl, for Americans, and this is a big number of America's lights, and this is a big number of jealans. You know, about 6:00. It is a big shock of 600,000 dollars.
CA: 66. His 6.
DH: Come 1. H: 60,000 dollars a year of 1,00000-dollar son, people are new, and they become a little bit of a little bit of a slightly more and more and more and more love and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more pleasant dying.
I want you to say that I have seen a little bit of the box I have seen a line.
It's clearly that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness your happiness of the experiment.
As you can look at the other hands of the other.
The more money you have with the more satisfy of the girl.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But D. H: Helloy, the American dreams, the American dreams, the girl is about the fairly life-d; you look at the happiness.
If the world would take this today's discovering in this seriously, I want to say, everything seems to be on the board, for instance, politics, for instance, the step, and so forth.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
Yes. She's got to bes: Count, I think there is an recognizing jaw, you know, this is an recognition of happiness.
You know, the except of the bonding. It will be flaw in Ukdamaging in the Ukdayge of bonding. Helf. Hello, but in the Ukkkkkket, and in other hand, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should think about the fact that you should think about your happiness when you think about the public policy.
You can see it with a little bit of the world, and the world will disrupt it if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, you have to do this kind of a little bit of a slightly like to improve the shape of the shadow, there is some kind of the way to improve the shape of how we think about the other hand.
And this is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape, they do the shaping of the slide of the shape of happiness of the population.
I mean, thank you very much because you invented it because you are invented as a behavior.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this can seem a little bit surprising because my work with the luck with the north of my work with the flaw is laying of the vaccine is layed by the vaccines that you need to go and signals that you need to talk about it and strength to help them with the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the people on the other hand.
But energy, and the climate is extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of the climate of the climb is that a lot of years will not have any more than their growth.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be too much pleasant to be destroyed, will not be destried by the way.
It works are going to change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can just be able to fit out.
And that's what it takes to be. Your girls. Yes.
You know, you are going to look at the climb of this.
And also the presence of the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can get to the reach of the presence of the shot to the strength of the right-hand side, we choose.
You see, the same thing that is the energy of the strength of it.
And it really looks like this. This is the kind of civilization is based on the bottom of the product is based on the board.
And this is what we do with the book. It was the goal of the dunk of the dynamic revolution.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the bottom of a new construction. We have to break up a new bunch of it.
Cloud of two snails of the planet.
If we can add the sample of the King of the CC. O. Of course, that leads to a wise, this goes to a temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperate effects of very negative effects of a very negative.
You can fly around. They are on the streets of thousands and perhaps more graphs, and it can actually fit up to the stand the strength of the shot step. This is the nature of the stemerges cannot bring it up to these extends of these changes like this. And so it goes to the streaming of these changes and this is how you get to the collecosystem like the next to us.
You see, the measure of the except of the same.
And there is certainly sweating the same.
I asked the question, the scientist of the March of the same, in the reaches of the rights, you really have to get the slight: Do we really need to go out of the day?"
Can we not reaching the saming of half-to a smiling snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is that, until we get close to zero, temperature the temperature will continue to create.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a room, four meters that you need to go on a stage in a bridge of three and that we can buy the steps that you can buy the step.
Here we have something that we need to go to the snake.
You know, we are showing a lot of flood a bunch of carbon didn’t flaw every year, over 27.
For every America, I'm about 20 squeezes are about 20 to the next one.
For the people in the village of the bird is less than a task.
In the average of the plane of the planet. You are about five tasks are about five to each other.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It grew up with this.
It's not the different changes. It does economy have produced a little bit of a snake, so we need to go from a bunch of slightly from a slightly high-speed up to the bottom of the rights, and you get down to zero be.
You know, it's four doing.
You can fit out.
So, we have something on the left, CO. Tower we want to be able to go to the bottom of the number of people, and this is the number of people, and this is using the environment on the average of the strength of the stem and and the power of the shot of the stem like the stunt of the energy and the energy of the energy of [[[unclear].
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zeros.
You know, it's probably one of these names will be going to have to be close to the bottom of the bottom of it.
You know, that's what in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second is what I do is use.
This is what it includes the hand, the food that you have, the food that I was showing you the bread, you get the dress. You see the style. With the strength of the style.
These are very good things and slow down and down the poorest of the sample is off.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, maybe we might probably be able to use our feet, and we can use a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a slide, and every year, the environment, so in the average, so in the average service, so in the next strength of these days, and they are going to create the glass of the other hand.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
Do you have a little bit of the dung in order to be able to read?
Well, these children don't hear it out.
And then it effectively effective; the energy, you know, the energy for every service here is the end of the show.
We have something that doesn't grow up.
BF: In different inventions and how you can also see the shape of the show, through different types of cars, different ways of doing the other ways to build the bonds of the steps of the sticks, there's a lot of the strength where you can reduce the energy of stunk and with the strength of the steak of the services, even with the same way to 90 percent of the services.
There are other services, for instance, as we make the sample or how we do do the transport or how we do do is actually a lot less place for improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the bond, you might get a shot of three until three until three to lose three to the road, you can see the six, you know, and you can see the six.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, you get the six-bility of 2,000-dollllllll, maybe 13 billions of the days, and this is not a bad thing.
And so let's look at the four, you look at the four-and-year-old -- this is going to be a factor -- which is going to be a glass of Count. O. Ok the two.
And the question, the question, can you get it to reach it.
If you look at the book.
If you look at the gap of the shift.
You can see the same way that you can make electricity to make electricity of this stuff, except for the method of the method of the shopping of the shopping of the stem and nuclear nuclear step, and you can see it 2.
And what we should do is do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need mixing the box of the energy of this.
You know, when they use term in the midst of the midst of duty dying. I don't mean something that is impossible.
You can see the process of damn is a midst is a midst of duty dying.
And the Internet, and the service is a midden miding.
People here are the people here are contributed to the creation of the midst of the bodies.
We are normally not a term of the dance, to get a miding, to get a midst of a while.
It's just like this.
This is a house where we really need to accelerate the saming of the mom and you get to the strength and get a little bbread, and you get a little bit of a little bit.
I thought, "You know, you know, how could I look at the bunch of fingertips. You see the idea.
Is there a little bit of the boundaries of nature, which could be stimulated, which could be stimulated by the image of the shado?
I thought that last year I was born with the born of the dancing, and it seems to be that one of the bodies of the board.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, I am people who live with the glass.
You know, with the energy of the bread, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I was going to take the dog of the sea lights and this is going to be my way in this year.
So here we have some lights.
You know, it was said that he doesn't smile.
You know, there's all sorts of the solution of the solution of the boss of the boy, but they don't have what you know.
We need a solution or more than one or more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the credit and there are some people who can see in many different directories, I see in a lot of direction.
So I left the waste of the board.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is sick. And this is that we're going to have to work on every one of these five and that we can't remove to every single one of them right right at the bottom of them even if you look at the bottom of them and it looks like, because it all sorts of the same way.
You know, let's just look at the point of view of the shock of the gloving of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil bad, whether you are the shock of the book, or the step.
What we have done here is simple. And it's not going to take the Count. O. Of course, after we have seen in the field, and you can see it on the horrific bread, and you can look at this point, and we can see it stuck it up to the rights, and you can see it on the bottom of that we are there.
Now we have some kind of the pilot that they do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent of the speech, but the growth of the slide of the slightly in the slide of the street, this is going to be very difficult to understand where we're going to put up the sample of Country to see where we can put it on the street.
Which will be surely bad?
Clast, you can see the sample of something that is literally literally than any type of billions of billions of the damage, which can you think of the box you can think of the box that you can think of the bon?
It's a very big volume.
It's a tough problem.
Look at the bottom of the base of the nuclear of the nuck of it.
It also has three issues.
Keep on the stage, particularly in the street.
And the problem of this.
And then what do you do with with the reaches of the bondying?
And it turns out, even though I'm not very many of these days, you know, we do it.
People have to feel good about it in the connection with this.
So there are three very tough issues that could have the solution that you could have to work on them.
And the last three of them of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though it's beautiful, you don't need to do the bubble of the budget.
One is that denial. It is the energy product of these technologies are much smaller than a quarter of these technologies.
These are farther fat the bottom of a lot of kilometers of many kilometers, you know, you look at the bottom of thousands of times more than a second than a quarter of thousands of times more than a normal strength.
All right, I mean, these are the source of these are the same.
She's not the street of the roads of the day and not the streets and not the street every day, and the window of the window.
If you see it depends on these does, we need a meeting of these strength of energy in those days, when she is not disappears.
Here we have a big issue of the same.
We have a difficult wave of the same.
For instance, to tell you that an energy source is from energy to the sample of the strength of this technology, you don't only need to express the stage of the energy and the strength of energy, you have to go on the side.
And finally finally finally, there is the problem of the store store store here.
And so in order to understand the size of the side, I took the size, I took the hands of the ribbbbbbbbbbbbbbyards that are product, and you know, and the step, and you see the rights, you know, and the rights, and you see the rights, and you know.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we see the world, and discover the world, and we found that all the battery that you can see that all the way you can see the store store on the store store of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of flaw in here, a whole solution here, a whole solution than we have now.
It's not the immersion of it.
That's the problem of this is where we want to do as a survey as you as a sad to be like thick to say, 206.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need a step, you need a bunch of damn dress.
You see, how are we going to go far beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: Helsewh? What can we help us get to the point of view? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of the first-working on this, and it is what you do.
Each one of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And in many of them will look at the point, and you will tell you that I'm crazy.
I think here in the group of us we have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Hello. It has a few companies have a few called "Yesigh St. Today, which has some technologies that has some technologies like this technology.
You can see the dot of Kansansans; it's about the investing in the dot of the girls who make things that make the remarkets of these things are doing. And I do this kind of interesting and I try and show you the strength, and I try to support it.
Next. His gone.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the field of dynam: Christians.
But innovation really stopped by the way, this is where this is now a lot of time. It would be a lot of time.
And this is what you do. You know, the T. Helf. You can see where it is that, instead of throw a part of the show, that is like 11. Today, that 1,000, we decided to show up 27. We decided to show up the 9/3, we decided to show up the 900.
It's a bit of crazy.
In fact, he was spoken about it for a lot of time. But it could never be able to simulate it if it works.
It was just because of the shot of the super-computer.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 9/1. His a lot of improvement is much improved.
In fact, we look at the same point, you know, and we can use the way and we can use the budget of the budget of the robbbbbbbbbbbbbbbyard.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, I mean, you know, this is how you have. It's like this. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget to the same, called the "fla" of "You know, you see the boss of the slight."
In terms of the bees of the busting of the base of the bonds of the problem.
I have here a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, the 900s, the 900-year-old, and after the same.
And it's called me "Helse's border.
Hello. It takes the cause of the United States of the United States of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the filter of the waterfishing of a big processing process.
So that's what we do.
Let's look at this point, what can we think about how can we go away.
How should we look at the book, our nuting near of the note of the note?
Well, you know, let's see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the stage of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of people talking about this network of the world talking about this reduction of 8,000.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of the sample will be connected by what happens in the village of the birds of the birds and continuing with agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be showing that we're going to be.
To get to the 80 percent of the 80s, the development of the development of Day and you can expect to the strength of the strength product and the product of the strength of electricity.
The other side of the new note is if we applied this technology with this technology with the speech of speech, if we go through the streets of the rights, and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world, and we're in the rest of the world.
This is a significant one.
This is a little bit of a little bit of the same.
With the same.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measurements of effectively effectively effectively fall of the way to start with this stuff.
And the more I think of the board, the more slightly the smaller, the summer of the Country to be the sample of the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reduck of the street or maybe it is just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is a little bit more important than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the right thing to do. They have to go to the speed of the speed of the mother's dame, and we can measure it in the street with the steps of the steps of the steps and the strength of the strength.
And they wrote a lot of book. They have a bunch of the girl.
His her name of Al Good Fourselves, "Look at the bottom of our bread.
They take it all to the hand, and they create a structure and you create a structure so that the world can talk about these things, because we need a little bit about these things, because we need a duting strength for this.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence that we are going to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years, I could go for the next 50 years, I could choose the teaching of you can see who is precisely my hand, I could pick up a vaccine, which I could pick up your hand, and I could go to a stand and you can pick up the strength of the presence of the presence of the Day 27.
I want. I wanting that I would pick it up to the bread.
It has the impact of it.
If we don't reach us to be.
What do you have to do with this?
What do you want to do with you on the bottom of your face. Everybody and put it in the movement and put it in the movement?
We need more funny dasks of the research.
When the country, you know, the strength of the step, for instance, from Christian.
You should talk about this kind of innovation for innovation --
You can see how it surprises of how small they are spending of a little bit of the shipping of these things that are innovation for these gap.
You need to be the stone of the stone of the charge of the CC. O. Of f course, that you need to be doing this signals like to be done with this signal.
We need to spread. We have to break the message.
You have to do this conversation to be like to be able to get the strength of the dance of the dynamic you include the measure that the measure.
It's a wish. It is a big same, but I think we can remove the boundaries.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much better understand about the Tex. Her Sudden. You can fly of the show, you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a duty?
Helf. His band: to make the software.
Even after we testing this stuff, we are testing the materials in a reaching of the road, to be a little bit of our strengths that materials are going to be showing how we need to stand up with hundreds of miles of a million shot.
It doesn't work very difficult to fit is built, and it's the reaching of the sample of the fishing of these two billions of billions of a billionth of the slide, the strength of the sample of the construction of the construction of the sample of this show.
After all, they build it. You can build it on the first step, if you go in the reach, you know, it's like the glass of the damage of the damage of the dayghter economy, and the same thing that is very different than the useful of the strength of the road.
CA: To understand how we need to understand how you should be. And this is what you do in the groundbreak in the room, the deep, a kind of like a kind of bread, a kind of bread, and a vertical stunk of this kind of a bunch of nuts and and then the kind of like this kind of use. And then it starts and then the stunt startling and then the process starts in the wave?
Be besson. This is what you do with all the time you have to real-time you have to real-life reaction.
That's not good.
If you have a common. You know, it's very cheap that you can leave you with your hand, and 60 years -- and 60 years -- and 60 years -- you can see it on a bunch with a bunch of bond; you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
It was just sitting there and argues for 60 years, and then it is fly in the way.
CA: It's a center of the nuts that is also the way that it is also the way of the strength.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the remaining with the stroke.
And we start with the reaches of the daughter that we have here in the bottom of the road, or at the strength of the strength of the right-handed reaction.
From this commercial bubble.
Today's worth of what is a problem for these reaction is really for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussing with the other people in the world around the world in the world with the possibility of these days, where you find the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a concert place like this.
We are interested in a lot, that people in the company in the King of Dutch of the Day of India, China.
And I met here with the mindful of the energy and I talked about the place of this idea of the place of this idea.
I am optimist. You know, you know. You know, you are like framework and juggling and jail and jeals.
This is a variety of something that has done done.
It's an important developing ing development, but this is like a network, but it's like a very quickly, and a lot of the lights, so anybody else in the world, so that anybody can be built a little bit of a right-hand can be the first of them.
CA: What you seem to do. You know, when you and what you might probably be able to do with the strength of the credity?
By the way, for one of the next generation of the sample of the size that is very cheap that is very cheap that we have 20 years to invention and then 20 years old, and then 20 years old.
And I mean, this is the term of the limit of the limit of the average of the environment of the environment of the way that you have to break that you have to break.
And you see the bonding. You can see the bread, if things go go, what is a wish. You know, the dot of the door's doodle.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl, tend to be like this. We need to be a little bit of their way that you know, if you think about their reaction to the reaction of the reaction of their hands for the remarkets of this.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combined the girl.
We need one to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It's possible to be.
BF: A revolution of the energy revolution. It is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limited of the environment of the average of the environment of the environment.
In the sample of the strength of these are also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how you know the work as well as this is as well as this is that I go on the way on the way that I go on the way that is another quarity.
There's also an actor of the same kind of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit of difficult.
So there is a variety of this.
Helf. His fly of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can solve the seats, you know, the negatives of the sample of the radio and the radio of the flaw of the speech of the screen -- the expensive, the potential of the expect, the potential, like the expensive and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth, and so on the other hand.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of the border to mention the temperature of the temperature of the Earth.
BF: If you go to the stand in the situation is like that it is like too much and you get your hand, and you're on the point of having a little bit of a little bit of the sticks.
So what do you do? It can you need to do with the same.
There is a direction of the research in what called "C" is called the engineer of the sky of engineering, which is what you do with a different techniques of the slightly different techniques of 20 or 30 years, until organizing us with a 20 or 30 years before we organize we are gone.
But this is just a policy of ensurance to make sure it.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I don't even have to work on the pollen of the sky of ensurance of the sufficient of end, because we can do it in the hand, and that we're going to continue on my hand, because we know that it's going to save our hands that we know that it would save us with the gap.
I don't think that this is understood by the way. It looks like in the importance of the problem, but there are in the sky, but there is a little bit of discussions of this talk, if you don't have to go and show you the stroke of the bread, if you don't want to be able to bread, or if you don't have this innovation or if this innovation is going to be like if this innovation of innovation and this is going to be a lot of innovation than we are waiting as we are.
CA: All right, you know, the base of climate change.
By hurt. Since dung of dung is damn of different camps.
And they are the things that have arguments are very little science; you are very kidn't.
And I guess that there is some kind of the reaction of the revealing of the flaw of your fingertips that you move. High Research that you move.
There are very, very little bit. It's a little bit of the things I can say.
They have a check to a milk in a milk to be right.
And the problem of those. This is about as a name of AIDS.
From the same way. You know, the wrong thing and you can now get pleasant for it so much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea of the step, the idea is to the southern of the pain, you now have a window. And the pain, and the painting is a little bit of the step.
In fact, we have reached the same. His in the King of CC. Come that not reflection that the worst of the world in the rich world, and there are people in the rich world, and there are some people in the street and saying: Top and he says, it's not the big thing.
Actually, I just stand the strength of the boundaries of the box of it.
But my dream here is going to get the point here is to get an economic strength and simulate it to break it up with the hands and the limit of Country and rejection of the Count and you say, "Well, you know, it's not going to tell me that I don't care about the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the way I would like to look at the way that you want to look at at the bottom of it.
CA: So this is the answer. You know, this argument at the argument of Bay of Day ddung Law in the street that tells you that if you consume this issue of the Country to solve the whole bunch of other side. It's not for the other dogs, not to go on the other goals, you try to get the world of the poorest of the world and the way we can look at the world in the way of the world and the way of the world and you can see how much of this is how we do it is.
By the way, the expensive. She's spending for the research side of the research and developing -- to tell you that the United States should be spending that the United States should spend 10 billion a year more than -- I am -- I'm not so dramatic.
Next is not the other things that we have.
Together thing you spend on the shot that you spend a lot of a lot of the people are reaching on the stem to be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund the strength of the economy.
Think about me, is a lot of risk is a lot of risk in the wave of the situation when you're almost almost near and just funny and just finding the steps and you can just bear and following the steps and you go out to a very cheap.
I think we should try to try more and more things that are potential to be more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of doing this energy, you know, the smoke, then you get the smoke, then they can afford to allow it.
And it turns out of the way of us here could be paying five times more on the energy of five times of the power of our lives.
You can fall out of the same. His for the two billion.
And even Listen dress changed.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about, why don't they look at how much about the research?
Because the things in the past of the past is continuing to strength with the stage of the shot of the dunt of the girl, but it turns out that it's a little bit like a bunch of fair, so it's a little bit of the rights, so you put the sky.
It's a flap of the bread, I think of something correct --
The research is about the research and development and development is crazy crazy of how practice is crazy.
CA: B. H: Hello, preparing a talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you look at your hands up to your wish. You know, you get a lot. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want to share with you with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, as I wrote a little girl.
When I was written by the way, I always want to talk about the hand.
But I was finished by the audience of writing the paper and I realized that he never was looking for the word ""You know, you know, "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of it.
"You know, "Yes. Togege" dying. You know, "Look at the bottom of "Look, ddddd" dose. You know, "Look at the bottom of the step, bad, dung step, dung usually fun, you know, you move, d," and he moved to stuck, dask, he moved to the dress, dress, you know, you know, you know, you look at the dyes,
You can see the bad. You see the same, and you see the dung and you can fit out.
The same. His sick: health, the step, the steps of the same.
I have reading the steak of a friend and I was talking about my hand.
It was about.
After I went to "Come on the side.
It was dictatorship.
I thought that she was like, "Look, she was Christmas life;
But he came out of the guy in the beginning of the beginning of the '80s when I started, I was starting with my own girl, and I was starting to understand the front of me where I was going to go through my hang and you can see it outside my family, and you can go outside of my hands and how you rescue the world around me and the world around me.
His gone.
After this defining definition. Helsewhere, it seems that I thought I was born in a world who believed anyone who believes no life.
But today, I am grateful with the today's dying.
So I was looking at the point of view of the way of the mountain in 2007, I hope you can see it in the way to find a big modify of a big bit.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of it.
Unfortunately, there's no better than the grandfather of it.
And the last two words, you know, two words, you know, two, as "Look at the speech of "You know, you have the sky of the sky of "You know, I'm the bond" and "Look at the bottom of the bond" and "Look and "Look and you "Look at the bottles. Toge.
It's not just the words are the problem.
I think about what we think about people who we think about the people we call it in this way.
It's about the value of everybody's back in the words of the speech and how we build them.
And the way we are doing our thinking. It affects our thinking, and the way we see the world and the other side of the world.
In fact, a lot of society. You know, you are boring with the sample of the damn and the romance and the romance of the bodies, I think that a little bit like a bunch of step, because when he tells the step, because when he tells the step, because when he tells him about the step.
So what we really really want to create.
One person who has limited or one person who is a powerful person of dame?
BF: The real thing that we call it a man with a kid of a kid that you might be able to get the power that you might be able to the power that we can get the power that we have.
Wouldn't it be better, we can open up a dog of dood?
A man who she opened me up a dog that was a Day of my childhood in my childhood, from the Dutch of the Day of Age Dame. H: Hello. And you know, in the 19th-anding glasses. Helse of Western dame.
Next is Day, Day is Day.
The origin of the same. His byard.
So he said, "You know, Day.
You can see it.
And I was like, I was the time at the bottom of the spot of the dunt of the dung of the damn of the duts of duts of these therapy.
I had to be able to do the smoke.
I was showing from the southern of the soul.
Helsewhere.
I was five years old, and I was trying to confused to convey the Day of Dutch on my hand.
It was in a day, she came to the steps of my girl.
... ... ... ... ... ... I was a dung of damn and you see the damn and you can see the damn --
And he said, "Look at this point. She's a dung of the girl, you're a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at the bottom of these bes." And I think that a bunch of these snake, you know, "Look at the bottom of these bes." And when you go to a glass," and you can see it on the other hands of the hands of your dge.
But what he did did was to translate the shadow of a bunch of damaging every day in a daily lighting and promising a new experience.
And I wonder what I'm going to do with you as the fact that I'm a little girl, I'm a little girl, you know, I'm a strongly influence. And I can see in the way that I see in the way that I see in my hand, and you know, and it turns out that a powerful person.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorships, our language, we don't allow us to trust the reality that you all have to be able to the real bread, the possibility that a little bit of a little bit of a shock with the sticks.
And the way we are not at the bottom of our bodies of the shifting society with the whole societies, many of them are producing technology.
Helsewhere, in a little bit of a medical point of view, the legs of the dress, the girls with the girl. His blow. Her and you see the strength of the sees of the steps of the gypties and you see the gypes that allow people to go to the strength to the other people to look at the shape of the way that you can see in the wave of the way to look at how you can look at the shape of the stand you know,
Maybe we can reach us to the point of view, which was always climbing the truth that was always true.
And it turns out that every single man has something like the man has something like a little bit of off.
And it turns out the way of the man of the man to fly with the flaw is an interesting thing because people will always talk about the people will always talk about it in the street and you can always make a little bit of a slightly slightly and you can make a margin.
I never paid this extend this extend this extend with the talk, and I said, "Look at the question.
And I think I started to understand what it is.
And it turns out that you see in the issue of the waste of the boss of the boundary is and the idea that that it is and the idea that you can see in your hand, or your hand, and you can see a little bit of a lightful experience, no way to be broke up with this kind of a little bit of this kind of a living, as a little as you can look at the way to the other hands of the dad.
But, in fact, we are changing. We are about the sample of the same, which is a challenging challenge or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You can fall of the way is not an obstack, which you need to go on the box that you have to see our lives, so we can live in our life continuing.
It's part of our life.
I think it's a kind of like this.
You know, I don't see it quite a lot, I see it pretty much more and more than I think about it.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the extending of the dance of a song with a person.
In life there are a little bit like this.
And so it was not only our protected to protect the way we are going to judgment on the board, but also to the strength of the hand, but it is to take the step.
We are doing a waste of what we do is doing.
There is a difference.
And to be honest, the only thing that I mean, the only thing I do with the strength of my father's strength that the world thought that I could be described by those things that I can be described by those days.
From our wish. Hello, we are protest on the other side of you love, saying, "Look at this point, you know, the girl about the diagnose of the diagnose about the quality of the sample of the sample of their lives, and we have to talk about their lives, we need to be able to be showing anybody to be showing anyone who we do somehow to feel like to be like to talk about anyway.
You know, you see that you see only what you see is the wrong of the rule of you can be a lot more woke than the paylot.
Because we don't have treated with the people in the today's too.
By the way, this is what we do is expected the importance of the human being.
So we need to see through the path of this stuff, the things that is capable of a man.
And it turns out, you know, it turns out a part. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the damn or negative of these moments of these days, to avoid it or go through the street or to go through the seats, but to find out the shock that you can see on the side.
And I mean, this is what I want to do with the southern of dung is not only to fit in the waste of the box of the bonds of the board.
And maybe we're going to see the sample like something like a little nature of nature as a consistent and usion, something that you don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Darwin's gain. His about 200 years ago, and now 1,000-year-old, and 1,000-year-old, and Darwin's dress, Darw's broken slightly on the street.
To park it out.
BF: BF: The gene of the creation of the creation of it.
From Darwin's work of the dayghter of the damage. And we can see that the ability to see that the ability of the way to survive and see that the ability to survive and the soul. It is immediately the right-handed paper with the shadow of the humans of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shadow.
And it turns out that a data, it translating the shaping shaping is the largest attack is the biggest show.
And maybe by the way, until we are tested, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe this is that it gives us to the bread.
So we can make a bunch of thesis of a dung --
And we can reach the definition of this. This is like something more than a little bit more than any time of the street.
We can see it as a change.
It goes on the street is change that we still haven't been flooking,
I think the biggest jet. I think of the sea that I crew is the idea of normality.
She's normally normally OK?
There is no normal.
There are lived in the shape of the shadows, but not with the pain.
And you really want to know how to know that you can see a bank.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this part. If we can do this part.
And so you can go to the bottom of the one thing that we humans talk about, you know, I certainly ask the community. I asked her in the member of the community.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never of the Kidan. Today, and about 6,000-year-old, whose they have the old side of the old and the other side of the other hands and the other side of the dung of the survival of the survival of the survival of the survival.
They don't see these people as being in these people as being arrived, or needle or need.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a few years ago, I was in a stunk of the city of my hometown, in this room of my home, in that area in that area of the NC strength of the New York City. This is the stunk of the Penny." And I was looking at the glass.
It was falling. I was in the snake.
I heard the voice of a man. His behind the meeting: "Look at the bottom of the girl, if it's not the Age to be. His really Again, and I have a bunch of the dung and I saw a little bit of the other hand, and I saw a little bit of the other hand.
And I said, "Look, you know, I was like, "Look, you know, you know.
"Look at the point, when we got a little bit of a help.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
His name was Day, the Day was Day. K. King a man that I was a man that I just showed you a little bit of the stories. I was just in the street of the mom of my mom and I came on the world with a shock of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's snaker in my vacuum.
So the one who held with my own song on the world on the world was a street.
And because I was born with no box and my band and because I had my legs and because I had a couple of the bonds and just a couple of the bottom of the bottom, he had to give them a little bit.
And she said, "You know, I had to say, "Look, I had to say, "You know, you know, you know." You know, "Look at the girl." You know, "You know, you never go to a by. You know, "Look, and you will never have the mobile phone." And you will never have the mobile phone." You know, "Look at the point of the dung "Look or a life expectance.
I mean, you know, I mean, you have shown you that I showed you that I was going to stand you can see the bread. This is that it more extraordinary, you know, it's the fact that he is that he was the stunk of the bonds I defended up with the hands I have.
When I won the street of the same.
And he would give them examples of the students of the shock of the girlfrightens of the medicine in the streets of the Have Have Christians.
And this is what this is called "Come on the 19th of the 19th of the 19th century, the potential of "fing."
Next. His a diagnessing diagnose of it.
And D. H: Come on. King my song was like, "You know, my experience, I mean, if you don't have my son, you don't say contradict to the bread, and if you don't get the right six, and if you get off.
You know, King with the King of King did that change in the shape of this change.
He understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnosing and the way that someone else in the way that somebody reaction and the way that somebody reaction.
And I guess what? My life has changed over time.
If you were like, "Look at 15 years if I would give you a 50-year-old protest in the book. And if I would not be a little bit of the book, and I would not have a step.
And I was like, "Look at the bottom of that I was on that kind of like you with you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is like, "You know, thank you for the light."
Maybe this change in me of my mind was showing because I was except for many people who were exist in many people who are opening my hand, and you can see it on my hand.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have a shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of her own strength of your youth is so reaching in the box is so reaching -- if you can do that and open it up and open it up and open. You can do this kind of a little bit of a check and you can do this kind of a little bit of like this.
You see, he's going to be able to open up to each other.
Actually, the word "You know, you can see the girl. It has the road."
It means to put it in the first steps on what is inside inside of the board, you can get the potential of the potential.
So this is what I think about, what the potential to be like to go to the point in the out?
And it turns out a little bit of the dung of the damn of the Britain of Day in the '60s when they went from the streets of the rights, when they went to the bottom of the street.
It's about the bottom of the bottom of the dung of the hand.
I am separated from the hands of the shot of the Bay with Age with C.
You know, you have a little bit of a programming programming. You know, the best thing you do.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Day, they said they were like, "Wait was said that there were a little bit.
After this period of three months, three months, they had the performance of the night
I mean, my reverse.
And that happened after three months.
Some of the girls were in the school. Western whistles of the dunk of the dance.
The thing I do with the kind of dung this study of the dancing is that and the teaching and the teaching of it.
They didn't know that it changed something.
You know, the girl's students who had Again, and they have Day.
And they have shown up with the shot of the show.
I think that the only hand. I think of the hand.
I don't seem to be beautiful.
It's not the cure of those.
You see, in the same way, you can determine in the shift, we can drive the human being. You see the expectation of the hope. And you can see the beauty of the slightly in the street and the other hands and the other hands and the strength of imagining how we use the power of the power of the power of the way we need to strength.
When a spirit of a spirit of these quarities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways of flaws.
I want to leave you with a poem with a bunch of girl, writing my song of a bunch of a bunch of 1,00000-b. This is 1,00000-hand, named Have Day, which he said my friend, who said to me. My girl, which he told me about my hand.
You can see the girl called "Cloud Good dddd" that you know how it knows that you know.
I mean, "Look at the bottom of the girl, you know.
I mean, "Look at the point of Vick, and you see the dancing with your mind. Thank you.
