A few years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman was shown a problem.
And the idea is quite simple.
Take a four has to build the highest structure of the sun structure of 20 steps in the spaghed, a bandwidth and a band and a frozen room.
It has to stay in the top.
And even though it turns out, it's quite simple, because it shapes people to collaborate very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea of design.
And it was a great success.
And since then, I kept almost 70 people around the world with design of all the world with students and designers, even the techniques in the top 50 Forton, and something from this exercise of the relationship of the relationship of collaboration, and I would like to share a collaboration, and I would like to share a collaboration, and I would like to share with you to share you with a little bit of a collaboration.
So, normally people start through the task.
It depends on it, and they imagine how it would show you, and then they spend some of the planning of the planet, organizing their own time.
It creates the back, and he arrives his spaghousing in the structures in the structures and then at the end and then at the end, even when they don't have any lived in the room, and Take a park, and Turk!
They add their work.
But what happens in most casualties is that "coo," because "Pho-oh-hour, because the weight of the whole structure to the whole structure to deform.
And there is a number of people who are part of the people who have a lot of times, and among the most disappoints of businesses.
They look at it, they lose their concentration, and they achieve the jalships.
And, of course, there are many more structures that have a lot more structures, and among the most of the bests of the grass.
And it's pretty amazing.
And as you say Peter, not only make the most interesting structure, but also the most interesting of the most interesting.
So you want: How do you want to ask? Why? Why? Why?
And Peter I like to say, "None of the children not lose time trying to be the director at Spage.
And they don't lose time to fight for power.
But it's another reason.
This is that the students are training to find the correct, right?
And it's executed.
And what happens is that, when I put flight on the top of the top of the time, and what does it happen?
It's a crisis.
Is it good?
What they're doing is different from the gardens, is that they start with the go, and they're building prototypes, prototyping prototype, so they have more hopes to remediate the prototypes to remediate part.
So designers, I recognize this kind of collaboration as the essential process.
And every version, the children have an immediately responding to what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So the capability to build in prototypes is essential to see how many different team.
So the majority of the average of 20 countries, the students are about half, a little bit better, but not with a lot of adults.
Who is the better?
Architects and engineering, fortunately, the most other structure that I saw 39.
And why is it? Because they understand that triangle triangles and the geometric models are the key to the structure of stable structure.
So, the general directors than the environment.
But it becomes interesting.
If you add a team from a man from administrative administrative improvement.
It's just incredible. You see you, and you look at it and say, "This is the team of it."
You can say this before. And why is that?
Because they have the skills of facility.
They take the process, I understand the process.
And any of the team that monitors, and it's attacking to work their performance.
The techniques and facility and their combination and their combination and their combination.
If you have 10 team that begins to build the six structures that are going to be in the legs.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's take a look at the field.
And I offered a 10-thousands of dollars in programming programming programs for the teams.
And what do you think that happened with those students at this point?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
No team has not built something that was going to stay in the leg.
If any team would be built, let's say, a three centimeter of three centimeters, it could be taken at home.
So, it's not interesting that the field of big impact?
I took the exercise with these students.
What does it happen?
It's just about the prototype.
And the same team has gone from the biggest result in one of the best results.
They have cooked the most structure in the longest time.
So here's some of the professor for us about nature and success.
So, what could you ask, why would you lose any of the problem?
And the reason is, I help you create digital tools and processes using digital tools and processes that are building cars and videos.
And what does this challenge is that it helps to identify the presence of hidden assumption.
Because, in fact, every project has their own bee, right?
This challenge us a common experience, a common experience, a common experience, a common position of a prototype.
And so this is the value of this experience of this experience,
And for those interesting, you can access to wwww.marsh. is a blog that you can see how you can see how to build with the bees.
They are also steps instructions about that.
And there are unusual examples of all the world of how people change the system.
You can find global record record.
And the fundamental lesson, I think it is really a sense of contact.
We're going to dedicate our tasks all the senses, and to appreciate what we have better for the challenge in front of the challenge in front of us.
And sometimes a simple prototype of this experience is the only thing that you need to make a moment of "oh-hour."
And that can do the difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's say we have a machine, a machine, a big card machine, which is TED, and that's a TED Talk, which is a long machine.
And everyone in this room, you have to be in this room.
You can go back, but you can't remain where you are.
I wonder what you want to do with my friends of this question in the last time and all they wanted to travel back in time.
I don't know. They don't want to come back before the invention of the automobile by Twitter or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a certain attempt.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of this group.
I don't want to go back in time and not because I did not think of adventure, but because the palette of options on this planet, but it has changed.
So, I want to go into the car and go forward.
It's the best period of this plane of this planet, wealthy, wealthy, the channels, the channels.
There is no longer than anymore.
All my grandparents died before to get 60 years.
My grandparents got to 70s.
My parents are close to 80.
So it would be good for the beginning of the age that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about people, because it's a lot more important than that.
A baby who are born in New Delhi has a greater life expectancy, 100 years ago.
Think of this. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
Varia. Varia. Varian killer billion people.
It reprofiled the demographic data in a neegal way.
Not anymore.
I got it.
In the rich world, that threatens of millions of people with only a generation of generation.
Dif, the role of the pole, the policy --
Where does it all mean?
Vaccinies, our modern drugs, our capacity to feed billions of people are travels of science.
And I think that scientific methods, put things on the trying to see if it works, it's one of the most achievement of the most achievements of humanity.
These are the good news.
Unfortunately, there is no more problems, because there are other problems, one of them, one of those of us have a billions of all of our achievement is that the water every day.
This number is growing very fast, and it is to the right condition.
It's not just that, but we used to destroy this planet.
Eighty disorder, the rainforests of the rainforest, the cloud and they will disappeared.
If we don't invent a way to come out of this journey, we will disappear.
The question is, can we do this? I think it is.
I think it's obviously obviously, we can produce food that we can feed billions of the Earth that they live.
I think we can run this world with this world with energy that will not destruction.
I really think that's not just an illusion.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wrap -- one of the things that I don't let me wish.
I never need a bigger progress of science than now and we never found in the situation of using a way to use it in the situation that we can do today.
We're in the practice of graduate event in many ways.
However, I think we should come back with three hundred years ago in time before the Christians, to discover a period in which we fight for the progress, for all these things with the force of these things with more frontiers than now.
People are crampons of their beliefs of their consciousness that you can't release.
Not the truth is not going to release.
Everybody has the right at a opinion, it really has the right to have an opinion, but you know what you haven't got the right now?
You don't have the right to your own truths. I feel bad.
And it took me a little bit of what I do.
Two years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines for "The New Yorker"Her articles.
I was imposed to be part of the viruses of what I was going to focus in the public health of the entire history of the entire history of humanity.
I didn't know what to do, I did is what I do is usual, I wrote a article I went on.
With that after that, I wrote an article about the genetic disorders.
The same thing.
People were taking the rub.
So I wrote an article and I couldn't understand what people thought about why people thought it was "food Frankenstein," why they thought that he thought that he was changing the molecule change molecules in a way that the laws of nature.
But, as you know, I do what I do. I wrote the article, I went on.
I'm just a journalist; we are archive, we go to somebody.
But these articles, they took me and I realized why.
It was because they were fancient in my mind, they were not defating.
There were people with good, educators at their place.
They were just like people in this room.
And it took me so many --
But then I thought, let's be honest.
We're in the point where we don't have the same relationship with progress with progress as far as now.
We're talking about the ambivalent.
We talk about it in terms, and we put it between the guild between guys.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We lost our belief in institution, in authority and sometimes even in science.
And we have the right to do.
You can see a few names and people will understand.
Cernobus, Bhopal, Bhopal, the Challer, Vioxx, the destruction of the destruction of the voices.
You can get your own liver.
There are questions and questions that we always think that they always have right.
So, you're a circumstance.
You ask the question, question, you sold evidence.
You don't take anything to go.
But here's what it is, when you get evidence, you have to accept it.
And I can say because we're in the middle of an epidemic of the size of an epidemic of the size of the size that I hope is not to meet.
An 12 years ago, he published an article that made the connection between the epidemic of autism and vaccines against the poverty, and the range of the pool.
Very rescue.
They did not make the studies to check if this is true.
They really had to be done with studies; it's an important problem.
They came up with them.
Remember from the United States, in the United States, from the South Canada and all they said the same thing: there is no connectivity, there's no connection one.
It doesn't matter. We don't convey but we take in serious seriously, what we see is that what we see is that what we doing, what we doing, what we're doing.
We don't believe a lot of documents coming from a government function from a data that gives us a data and understand that, I think we all understand that, I think we all understand that, I think we all know.
But you know what?
The results were disastrous disaster and here is one of the United States is one of the countries in the world where the rate of vaccination against the rate vaccination is low.
This is unfortunately, we should be routine.
It's terrible.
What did I get here?
I understand it.
Does anybody here in this today?
Does anyone in the audience of someone didn’t water?
It doesn't really happen.
In this country, but it doesn't happen, but it happened 160,000 times in the world.
A lot of a lot of the bridge, 20 cases per hour.
But because here was not happened, we can not think about this and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy can reveal messages using emissions like Oprah and Larry KLive.
And I can do that because they don't do the difference between causality,
They don't understand that the same thing, but not coincidence before.
And we have to teach that we have to learn what it is.
This guy, Jonas Sulk, it was a eroud.
It took us from one of the biggest gap.
Without no frame, policy, policy, policy.
The guy in the middle -- not the teacher.
He called him Paul Off.
The worst has developed a vaccine with a vaccine with a dog.
It's 400-500-year-olds in developing countries, in developing countries.
It's a result, right?
It's good, just that Paul talks about vaccines and how people are supposed to be slowly slow.
And it really forward.
So, Paul is a terrorist.
When Paul talks in a public audience, you can't be protected by the shelf of the gap.
It's called home because people love to tell them that I know what my children are going to school.
Why? Because Paul has made a vaccine.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
If you get them back, the disease, you get terrible diseases, and it even happens.
In this country, we have now related.
It's the more worse, the children will be worse, the children are going to die, but it's just a statistical problem.
And it's not going to be layer.
How do you stay with the policy? Let's have this and this?
Two weeks ago, he was a college of college and told me that I'm sorry.
Nobody ever said anymore.
He had no way to vaccinate their baby against the policy.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the policy. Do you know what?
There were no cases of policy in this country.
But today, it may not know that a guy in the morning in an airplane in Los Angeles, and it will avoid out of the Los Angeles, now it's on the state of the Ohio.
It's going to aterize over two hours, and it will come in Long Beach one of these wonderful dines in one of these wonderful dinners in this evening.
It doesn't know that it's infected with a disease that challenge and we don't know that the world.
This is the planet that we are living not as well.
We like to teach us to learn in our lies. We love this at the crazy.
He took the whole world of the morning of the morning?
China, a little antioxidant to work.
I know you've done this because half of the population is doing this day.
They have these things and they go to the alternative medicine and it doesn't matter how often they are all the uses.
The data shows the same thing.
You can make your color to the color and usually more.
It's okay, you want to pay for 28 billion dollars for the color.
You don't have it.
Take up to the color to the color.
Why do we do this?
I think that I understand -- we get the sun producers of farms.
The government. We don't have the government.
And we shouldn't haven't have. And our public health is nose.
It's cruded by millions of people.
It's incredibly remarkably remote to the suffer of those that you can afford it.
So we slow it up to him.
And as a replacebo.
This is fantastic. I'm sorry.
But, in fact, it's a very serious because these things are smiles and spend on billions of billions of billions of dollars.
I have here all kinds of objects.
None of them -- the Kkgo, the step, the tissue, you don't even know what it is, but you spend billions of dollars on this, but we spend a whole country.
And you know something? When you say that, people are looking at me and you say, "What do you want to do what you want to do to feel good."
You know what? You know what?
Because I don't care if the secret of the state of the Minister of the Minister who says "Hmmmm, not to take a look at the experiments of my mammography that would like to treat and tremendous jail that would like to treat the cafe.
When you go on the road, the magic and the magic and the science and the science, you get in a place where you don't want to know what you want.
Take in South Africa of Thabo Mbeki.
He killed 400,000 people inssisting at the wheelchairs and the late of the wind and the anti-retrovirals that we know that the antiretrovirals that we know that they slow.
Two of thousands of decades in a country in a country becomes so much more than anyone else in this disease.
Please don't tell me that there is no consequences for that.
There is no one.
The lesson of the sense of epidemics that we haven't even now this fight between the debate of the defense of the defense of the food and elevators of organic foods.
It's a controvercled. You have to start.
It's a controversy to the words, to metaphor.
It's ideology, not science.
Anyone of the footprint, every fight of the rainforests of Bruxellyfish.
In the garden of Eden, there were no eating.
And no fish.
There were no way of County. We did it. We did.
I did this for the last 11,000 years.
Some of them were OK.
I got down by the ones that don't have.
Now we can do it in a more way.
Of course, there's the risk.
But we can put speech, and that can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, teaching their lives.
You don't want to do this?
I have to be able to understand that I don't understand.
And we are designing against genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, we always hear things go: The dogs, pesticious chemicals, we don't want the surfaces, we don't want the surfaces, we don't want a single thing, it's wrong.
We don't want our companies to make sure for life.
We don't want our companies to deters.
Do you know what my answer to all this?
Yes, you have to repart this.
That's how we have a big problem with food.
This is nothing to do with science.
It's legs, it's morality.
You know the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process that sometimes works, and other people don't have to allow her science to allow her science to afford his science to make it because it is very smart and strength.
In the next 50 years will be able to produce 70 percent more food than 70 percent of food than the present.
70 percent.
Here's what investments have done in Africa in the last 30 years.
The same.
They need that, and we don't know.
Why? Why? Why?
We don't want to encourage people to eat people to eat people to eat.
500 million people eat than ever.
It's kind of like a cartoon.
It just quics. It's terrifying.
There are no substance of proteins and proteins and scientists, and scientists introduced all these in this moment.
And then people will be able to eat anything.
Will not suffering and you know something?
It would be good. It would be like to Chim Panism, but it would be good.
What can I tell you this: Why can we be?
Let's ask this question: Why are we going to ask ourselves?
Because we don't want to change the gene?
It's just about the genes. Not chemicals. Not chemical.
It's not about our passion for hormones, about the hormones, about the insistance to have better than the size of the bigger level, unfortunately.
It's not about deeply for the mic, but about people in life and come up with the time to understand what it means.
Because you know what?
If we don't do it, if we're going to keep wearing us as wearing now, we want to be guilt from something that we don't think we want to be guilty colonization.
We can't describe something like what happens.
It's ego, it's a bad, it's under our level and even we need to slow.
So, after this incredible discussion, you might say, "So, you can you go into this meat this time you want to travel in the future?"
Of course, not. Of course yes.
Now this is a present to the present, but we have an opportunity.
We can program the time we want.
We can move it anywhere we want to do it.
We need to take these discussions and we need to think about it, but when we go to the time and go forward, so we do that.
I know that we can also see that the world has the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A day Steve Los Angeles from Los Angeles Times TTTimes TTTimes in the center of the Los Angelese.
And it was a man, an American African-American African-American Africa, a man man man man man who only had two code.
And I tell you a story that many of you know, because Steve wrote a lot of articles that became a book, and after he did a film, with Robert Downey Dowz, and Jamie Ayand, Jamie Ayand, Jamie Ayand, Jamie Ayers, contrassisted by an education at Juky had been a short presence of a dynamic trageous.
Nathaniel released to the school, and 30 years old, and 30 years later, without the house, he lived on the streets of Skid Row in the center Los Angelese.
You recommented all of you to read Steve or see Steve or see the film that you don't only do beautiful not just the beautiful between these two people, but the music has helped in that music has helped the shappier, and it turns out to help Nathel to help Nathel to help Nathel Nathel to help Nathel up on the street.
I met him on the Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at the Disney.
The interpretation of the interpretation of the symphony of Beethoven Beethoven and came back.
He was very game in a very game and social way.
I talked about the music. I got an email from Steve a few days later he was interested in a vivibration with me.
Now, I have to mention that Nathaniel refuse to treatment because it was treated with the therapy and Thord and Thorazine and Thorough the cycles that will remain their lives.
But as a result now, it's prevent to these fish.
And the most of them can manifest as he explained it as he explaining more of the streets in the streets in Skid Row, with the torture in Skid Row, with the torture in the head.
And Nathaniel was very aggregated when we started our first lesson, he had some kind of expensive, it was gone.
And she was talking about invisible and girl, and when someone stopping him in the sleep.
And it was frankly, not for me, but it was going to lose it was going to lose it in one of his stations. And that I will start talking about his relationship if I start talking about the game and other forms and other forms and other forms and other forms and other forms.
So I started playing.
And I have the first part of the concert of Beethoven.
And as I was playing, I understood that a profound change in the eyes of Nathaniel.
It was like how it was the influence of invisible drugs, a chemical reaction, because the musical reaction to me was the catalyield of me.
And the manipulation of Nathaniel was tranformed in the understands a curiosity and degree.
And like in a miracle raised his own lifestyle, and he started playing in the concert in the concert that I asked him to fight me to fight me to fight me to the complete, Mendelusion, Tchachachair.
And I started talking about the music, from Beethoven, and Brahms, Brucker, Brucker, Brucker, from all from Bartk, from Bartk, to Esa-Pe-Peka Salonen Salonen.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the encycle knowledge of music, but he had a person.
I think about it with that passion and understood with my colleagues with my colleagues from Los Angels.
And while I was interpret and I was talking about this man in a paranoid, that just came out of the Los Angelese, in Los Angelese, in this musician in this musician of Juilliard.
Music is the therapy.
And for Nathaniel, the music is psychological health.
Because the music allows to take their own thinkers and illustrates them through their imagination and their creativity and their creativity, in reality.
And this is an evaddiction of the sufficient.
And I understood that this is the same.
This is the reason that we do music, we take something that we are in our fundamental emotions, and our emotions and our artifacts, with our artifacts, we modeling those emotions in reality.
And the reality of the expression of us, and we impress us and retired, inspiring ourselves.
And for Nathaniel, the music has brought back to the friendship.
The release release of the musicians brought back to a musicians who recognize it.
I will always make music with Nathaniel with Nathaniel, or in Skid Row, or in Skid Row, because I became the musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I want to sing something that I would provide with no range from violence from violent violence as well.
So, please.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm an designer.
I think about the 10-year-old.
And my goal for the next decade is to try to easily get the world in the real life in the world in the games in the games of the games in the games of the games of the games of the next decade.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves more of the world, including the present of the present here to spend more time playing games and better.
So now we spend three billion hours a week on the week playing games of online.
Some of you might think, "It's very long time spent playing playing game."
It can too much of the time it takes a lot of things that we have to solve the real world.
First of all, conform of my research, at the Institute of Vike Institute, it's just bad.
Three billion hours on the road is not as long as you can get enough time to solve the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the future of century on this planet, we have to grow dramatic number of hours.
I calculated the total, we need in 21 billion game every week.
So, this is probably a little bit of intuitive.
So I will tell you again, I'm going to leave him with it.
If we want to solve problems like foods, poverty, global ships, global conflict, I think we need to be able to hide play, I think we need to play the playground games for the last 21 to the last week to the end of this decade.
This is why. This picture of what I think about the games are so essential for the future survival for the future survival.
This is a picture of a picture called Phil Tolano.
He wanted to capture.
So he argued a camera in front of the players of the players.
And this is a classical emotion emotion.
Now, if you're not a gamer could lose one of the photograph.
You may probably see that the need to take action of frame, but the intense concentration of a very difficult attention to a very difficult issue for a very difficult problems.
If you're a player, you're going to see some of the cloud of the eyes of the eyes of the dogs are signs of optimism.
And the springs are a surprising signal.
This is almost a gamer that is almost called an epic.
Oh, you heard that. OK. OK. OK.
So we have something like new games of us.
A wall of it is a result that is so extraordinary of positive that you cannot achieve it until you win.
It was almost beyond the limitations of the imagination.
And when you reach up there to discover that you're really capable.
This is a player on the way to get a wind.
And this is the face that we need to see in millions of people who solve the world as we try to remove the next century.
From the daughter who is on the way to get a way to get a wild.
Now unfortunately, this is a face that we see more often in our life with the day, as we get ourselves from the issue of urban issue.
This is what I call "I'm not good at life."
And this is my face. Can you see? Yeah. Can you see it? Yeah.
And this is really going, "I'm not good at life."
This is a degree piece of my neighborhood of my neighborhood.
In Berkley, California, where I took my doctor's doctors that we are better in games than in real game.
And this is a problem.
We feel that we're not as good as we are in reality as we are in game.
And I don't mean good as in "success," even though this is a component of a different component than in real games than in the real life, but when I say good about doing something that I think about doing something that confident to collaborate and coops.
And when we are in the virtues I think that many of us become the best version of ourselves, the most disappearable to help in a moment, the most likely to be able to focus on a problem, and I try to stand see what it takes to do with a check and trying to get out of it.
In real life, when we're puting in front of the failure, when we confronted with the obstaction, the most often we don't feel like this.
We are feeling.
We feel like anxxious anxious, frustrated or dinner.
We have no sense of feeling that when we playe, they just don't have in the game.
So, that's what I wanted to study when I finished my college.
What is the games of games that make sense of safety that is nothing what can we do?
How can we take these sense of games and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at games like the World Warcraft, which is really a collaboration for solving problems.
And I started to see a few things that make the wisdom of things that are so full of these onlines.
So the first thing is that you get in one of the kind of online online games in the World Warcraft, meetings, many characters that are willing to trust their mission that would save a mission that would save a mission that would say.
But not any mission, but a perfect mission of your weight in your game. Right?
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a attempt.
But this is the limit of what you can be doing. So, you have to strange.
But there is no man in the World Warcraft.
There is no strength and the loss of time.
There's always something clear and important to do.
And also there are tons of collaborators.
Whereas you go, hundreds of thousands of people to work with you to work with you to reduce your own mission.
It's not something that may be possible with your life in real life, this feeling that in your own collaborators.
And in addition to that, this is the epick story of why we are there and what we're doing.
And then you receive all this feedback.
You have heard of growth in the level, and plus one and plus to one of the intelligence.
We don't get these feedback in real life.
When I go on this stage, I'm not going to be pleased at speak and plus 20 to the ideas of living ideas of living.
I don't get these feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental environments like the World Warcraft is that it's so satisfy to the point of won the point of won the point of won the point of these virtual worlds.
It's just better as reality.
So now, by now, in the collection of the Warcraft players have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual issues of the Azerland.
Now, this is not necessary.
It could sound like if it was a bad thing.
But to put that in the context of 5.93 million years ago that our first straight in the leg.
That was the first first first step.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we invent playing games, the only way that it has senior to think about it, it is to talk about the human magnitude, what this is an extraordinary.
But it's really going. Because it turns out that you spend so much time playing the game, we really change what we are capable of what we are capable of human beings.
We evolve to a species more collaborative and heart.
That's true. That's true.
So, you take this kind of interesting statistics.
It was published by a research at the University of Carnegie Mellon.
The young people in the bird of the day with a country with a strong culture will be spent 10,000 hours playing playing 10,000 on the age of 21 years.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for the next 10.80 hours is the number of hours that you will spend in the classroom, and until you finally finally finding the high school if you never lack from the own.
So we have a whole parallel of education that are happening in which you learn as much about what you need to be a lot about what it takes to be a good gamer in school.
And some of you probably read Malcom of Malcom Glady Gladby Outliers.
So, you're going to be heard about success theory about 10,000 success.
It's based on the amazing skills of cognitive domain that tells you that if we can resist 10,000 hours to look at the age of 21-year-old, we're going to be specialist on that subject.
We're going to be as good as we do as well as the biggest personalities in the world.
And so, what we're looking forward is a whole generation of young people who are specialized.
So the big question is, "What is the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had an unattacked resources in disappearance.
Here's how many people have now in the world that spend at least one of the day playing game.
These are our experiments.
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
And in the next decade we're going to have one billion players who are extraordinary at any point of the good thing.
If you don't know why.
Industrial games develop consoles that consumption and work on energy and work on the network in the Internet-wireless of the Internet, in the Internet band and in Brazil, China, Brazil, China, they can connect online.
They estimate another billion games in the next decade.
That will bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking about what these experiments.
These are the four things that we discovered. The first is the urgent.
OK. Take this as a very extreme motivation.
The urgent is the wisdom is to actionize in front of the obstacle of the obstacle that we have an opportunity.
Gamers always thought that a won is possible and I always won to try and try to try and try to try and do now.
Juckers don't stand ba.
Gamers are experts at the clock of a powerful social tissue.
There are a lot of studies that look like people more than if we play a game with them, even if we play a game.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with somebody.
We have trust that someone will spend their time with us, that he would play with the same pattern, and they will take it in the game, and they will go to the end.
And so, playing with someone with a game with someone really building connections and cooperation.
And as a result, we build social relationships.
The happiness. I love that.
You know, there is a reason why the player of Warcraft playing 22 hours per week per week, think about a part.
It's because you know, when we played a game, we are even happier working on tall, than when we relaxed or when we go to your friends.
We know that we're optimized as human beings, human beings, and full of sense.
And the players are willing to work hard to work very hard to all the time, if you get the right way.
And finally, it feels like that.
And I love to be attacked by the mission that inspire the planet.
So, just a little trivial to help us see things in the perspective.
So, you all know Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
And the second largest wiki, almost 80,000 articles is the World World War craft is the World War craft.
The millions of people use every month.
They compiling more information about the World War craft through the Internet than any other subject than any other wiki in the world.
They build an epic story.
They convey a resource of Warcraft.
Okay, so we have this four super power that buy in a single thing.
Gamers are powerful individuals and full of hope.
They are people who think there are individual capability to change the world.
And the only problem is that I think they are capable of the virtues but not the real world.
This is the problem I try to solve it.
It's a economist called Edward Castronist.
It's genius is genius. He studies that people invent so much of time and energy.
And he says, "We are margins to what concrete in any extend any more than an exod to the virtues and virtual environmental environment."
I mean, it's an economist. So it's rational.
And he said, "I'm not that -- I am a game designer, and I'm an exuberance.
But he says, that this actually has a cloud senior because the players can get more in the life's lives.
They can have more powerful social relationships,
They get the feature, and they feel more worse than in real games than in real lives.
So, he tells you that now, has a sense for players to spend more time in the virtues than in the real world.
Now, I agree that this is rational, for the moment.
But it's not a case, an optimal situation.
We need to start doing the real world more like a game.
So I travel the inspiration in something that happened 2.500 years ago.
So these are ancient waste of an hour. Right?
Before we had extraordinary controlled by the juggling of the end.
And these represents the first teams of the human beings.
And if you're familiar with the work of the Herod, you might know this story.
Which is the history that invented games and why.
Herodods said that games, and in particular games, and in particular, they invented the Lydies were invented in a moment of Lydie.
Aparently, there was a lot of the Lydies decided that I had to do something crazy.
People are supposed to be.
It was an extreme situation. They needed an extreme solution.
So, confident of Herodoor, they invented the games and they defined a true politics and they define in all of the road.
And one day, every single one of them will eat.
And the next day is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the games because the games are so sold in a productive productive productivity and learn that they will ignore the fact that they would ignore the fact that they would ignore the fact that they didn't have the hand.
And so the day they played the game, one day they will eat.
And it confident with Herodoor, they lived as 18 years, surviving a day and playing in one day and playing games in the other.
Now, this is exact, the way we use the games today.
We use the games to slow the suffer in the real world.
We use the games to fall of what is stricted in real environmental environment, all of our life and received by our life and receive what we need in play.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
BF: Herodoing, after 18-year-olds not attention.
So the registers decided that they would play a waste of zards.
They divided the entire regard.
They played a game game of zards, and the winning to go into a chance to go into an adventure.
They will leave Lydia.
And they will go to caught up a new place where it was only the people to survive with how many people to survive with the few resources that were available, and hopelessly, and hoping the civilization where the civilization would be able to make prospery.
Now, this sounds crazy, isn't it?
But recently, DNA has shown that they showed that the Roman Imperiod of Roman, they had the same DNA as the Lydia.
And so, researchers have suggested that the great story of Herodoor could be true.
And geologists have found evidence of a global warming that almost 20 years and what they could be explaining about 20 years could explain it.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save their games playing the games for 18-year-old games for 18 years and then you can be so inspiring and knows so much about how to go through the games that actually rescued the entire civilization in this way.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing Warcraft in 1994.
That was the first game game game in real time in the World Warcraft. This was 16 years ago.
They were playing games for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 16 years.
I say that we are all the way for our own game.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he went to watch a new world.
So, in this 21-billions of hours per week.
Let's find out half of us to convince half of us to be able to play a half-hour-time video games until we solve the problems of real lives.
Now, I know you wonder, "How can we solve the problems in the games in the games in the game? Well, this is the work in the last few years, in the last few years, at the Institute.
We have this money to our officers in the Palo Alto our opinion of our future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to imagine the best scenario.
And then we want to empowering people to transform this scenario in reality.
We want to imagine the wisdom and then give people the migration of the people to get these windows.
I want to show you very short three of the games that we try to offer people who are trying to bring people in their own brains.
So, this is the Law FPetr.
I created this game in 2007.
This is an online game where you try to survive of an oil crisis.
And the oil spill, but we put enough there in there so enough enough that you can think it is real-life life life life life as we haven't got oil in this game. So, when you have no own. So when you live in this game, you tell us where you live.
And then we send your video in real time that you look at how much you look at how much of the oil, which is not available to focus the source of food is affected the transportation, if they are protesting.
And you have to imagine how you live your life if all this would be true. And then we give you in a blog on a blog about this, to write, public photographs.
I tested this game in 2007 with 1700 players.
And I watched three years since then,
And I can tell you that it's a transformation.
Nobody wants to go through the life of the world, or because it is good for the world, or because you have it.
But if you include in a wise, and you say, "We're going to remain without oil.
This is a great story and a fantastic adventure.
Let's challenge you to see how you survive.
Most of our players were supporting their players who have learned in this game.
So, for the future you can save the world, we decided to keep the world with more than the lack of oil.
I created a game called Superstructure called Superstructure.
And the premise was that a supercomputer, calculated that people have only 23 years of spent on this planet.
The computer is called the Global Extincent System System, of course,
I asked people to come up with almost like in a Jerry Bruckheimer.
You know of Jerry Bruckheimer's shaping a dream.
You have astronaut, the man man man man man, and they all have something to do to the world.
But in our game, instead of having only five people in this team in this team of vis, I told you that you all do part of the dream and it is the future of the energy and the future of the 20th and the future of social security and the future of social security and the future of social security and the future of social security and the future of social and the future of social and the future of social future.
I had 8,000 people who have played this game for eight weeks.
And they invented 500 solutions that you can see if you can see if you can see if you go on the Google.
So finally, the last game, the last game, we launched it in three marties in collaboration with the Institute of Bancar Global Global Institute of the Global Institute of the Global Institute of 2010.
And working with the university of all sub-Shian Africa, and they invent techniques of social innovation.
We have a graphic novel. We have growth in the local attack, social intuition of knowledge, socialization and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity to be full of resources.
I would like to invent you to share this game with young people in the world, especially in the world, especially in the world, especially in the developing area that could benefit from the developing areas to try to imagine their own social companies that would save their own social companies that would save the world.
So, now I'm going to happen.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think that is going to happen?
We all have these amazing players, we have these games that are kind of a pilot version of what we could do, but no one of those of them didn't save the world.
So you hope that you will agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use to work for the real world, that games are a strong.
We all have these amazing superpowered productivity productivity productivity, the ability to keep a waste of social relationships, this sense of optimism and the desire to have a sense of optimism and the desire to have a senior.
I hope that we can use our games to play games to play games on this planet for a century for another century.
And it's my hope that you are going to join and play games like this.
When I think about the future, I know two things that we can create any future that we can create any future, and we can play any game.
So, I say, let's start the games that change the world.
Thank you.
So some time I am interested in the effect of the advice that would seem for a magician, just if you think about it as if you think about it as I think about it becomes a real thing, it becomes a real thing, it becomes a real thing, it becomes a real thing.
Of course, the other hands have a measured effect of studies, the effect effect of studies, just because the person thinks that what happens is a pharmaceutical effect, or something like --
For the pain, for instance, if you think about it, in the body, in the body has a measured effect called the advice effect effect.
Somebody's becomes a real way that anybody in a perception.
So in order to begin to show you a very simple trick, a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that you find in 1950.
And I learned from Cub Scout Magic in 1970.
I'm going to show you and then explain.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
The circle you can look at my hand, my hand, you can see it.
I'm going to keep the board.
I'm going to travel your hand.
And in order to make sure that nothing goes from my hands or not to my hand.
To see that there is no circulation on here.
As long as you get out there is no way out of my hand.
And it's quite simple.
I'm going to open your hand, and I go, if it all goes, my animal.
In fact, it's so good enough that I can break the food, and the country, and the country.
No circle or from etheless, without farming. And you can look at everything.
Ta!
I often teach the children of these children who are interested in the prices, because you can learn a lot about the footprint of the forest.
Probably many of the people here know it.
Here's what happens.
Science in your hand.
And I tell you that I'm going to get my hands with my hang I would have nothing to go there, it's a living.
And the reason why I was in the prison is actually the secret of this illusion.
At the time, my hand is motion in front of you and you don't see it, and it doesn't look at the fingertips where it is by the kind of like this.
Helf.
In this is a childhood.
So, that's how it works.
And as I said, my finger, my finger moves their position.
And we can talk about why in the heroe, why don't notice that there are only three fings, because there are just three frogs, and the way it processes that information, not number one, two, three, two, three, two, three.
But that's not what it is.
The customer is there, not by magnetism, but through a trick, it takes my show.
And then when I see the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, the movement, the movement, the movement, the motion of my finger.
I give my hand. And I give my own.
So you can do this friends and neighbors and neighborhoods.
Now, what is connected to the effect effect.
I read a study, a year ago, who opened my mind.
I'm not the doctor, so for me that for this was amazing.
It turns out that if you administs, you have a samebo shaped in a blue shape, just a blue peak, it has a certain effect.
But if you change the shape where you administs, you get a smaller past, you get your blue on it in a literally effect, you get a little bit bigger effect.
Although no one of these pasts are not substitutions -- are the phase phas.
But the bottom of the white is not as the blue.
How? That's my mother?
And yet it turns out that it doesn't stop here.
If you take the capsule, there are more efficient than the camels.
A collar capsule, the yellow in the head and the other one is better than the white head.
And with the dozen is a stuff.
A phase of two times on the day is not as good as the time -- not the study of the time.
But the idea is,
-- and the evidence.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the sample effect that you have to come up with it.
Yeah? A series with something inerties, a few centimeter of something inert, and injection --
So this is such a very powerful image for them, much more powerful than the blue.
This is real, okay, well, I'll show you another time to show you the slide.
The idea is that the peak is not as good blue as the blue is not as good as a head, and it's not as good as well.
And it doesn't have any farmaceutical quality.
It's only our belief in our body and produal in our body and produce a more powerful effect.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of magic.
And I take something that is obviously a trick, and make it real.
And we know from that study, if you want to use it.
This is a sevention of seven steps. It's very cloud.
And I'm going to drive it.
This is my hand.
This is my skin. It's not a particular effect of Hollywood.
I will find my skin and I will travel with this one.
If you are sensitive -- if you go out -- if you get this for a few friends in the hotel in the hotel room, and there were some people who don't know.
So, I suggested that if you do quickly, you want to look at the next part of the next few minutes -- in fact, you don't know what you do the first part of it.
You will see you, you will look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of my arm, I will make a little gap.
Is it a human being?
And now I go through the piece, and you take it on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point as well.
That's what it is.
But now you can't count my fings, right?
Well, let's look at it. Look. Look, two, three, four, days, four, fire.
Yeah.
I know what people think about when I see this.
He said, "Well, it's not that good enough to get us to distress us for a few minutes, take a few minutes, look at a little bit.
What does it look like?
Yes, you know. And those in the back of the back, I really don't have seen that.
Let me show you.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect from Hollywood.
This is my career, and I can hurt.
I mean, if you think about it, if you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
Those in the back, or those who will look at the video of the video, "E, okay, it looks pretty cloud, but if it would have a hole -- if there was a hole -- if there was a hole in there and some other hand, if it would be a blood and some of blood and some of the blood and some blood.
Yeah.
I would normally take the act.
I would like the hand and I would have no idea that I didn't look at any time.
But I think in this context and the idea of taking something like to transform it into something real, and I'm going to leave it in the stage.
We see a few times of the day.
I hope that you expect. Thank you very much.
So, I met a lot of fish.
I just loved it.
The first was more like a passionate business.
It was a beautiful fishing of sweater, whatsoever.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farm of sustainability of sustainability.
So you could feel good when you come in.
I was in a relationship with this beauty on the street.
And one day, the director of her company called me and asked me if I talk about a event of my health.
"Of course, I said.
Here is a company trying to solve what has become this unimagined for our kitchens.
How do we look at the fish on the menuels?
For the last 50 years, I fished in the field and oceans as deforestation.
It's hard to figure out the destruction.
90 percent of the season, the sea that you love, the lady, the sleep, the fish.
It's almost disappearance.
So as well or cool, cookroach, I become a part of our future.
There are a lot of controtes.
And the fish of the pollution, at least most of them do, and they have a redded productivity you see the table.
A major difficult tough.
The Ton has a rate of conversation for 15-year-old.
That means that you need 15 pounds, the waste of the wild to get a fer.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the taste.
So here's the end of it, it was a company that try to do it.
I wanted to support.
The day before the event of the event of the public relationship in the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "Just to put things on the point, because you are Western because you look at the season."
"Corect," he said, "We're so far from the waste of our fishs are not focused on our fish are not concentrate."
Then he added it, "We're actually a new world.
Remememitting food? 2.5 to one one."
"The best on the market.
2.5 to one.
"2.5 to one use of it?
"Proted," he said, "Helse."
"Grozav," I said, I find.
And in that night, I was born in the pitch, and I think, is a sustainable protein is a sustainable protein is a sustainable protein.
So the second day before the event, I called Don.
I said, "Yeah, let me some examples of sustainable proteins said that you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the company.
No one could give me a cloud.
And finally, I talked about with the biologist biologist.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "Let me some examples of sustainable proteins and somebody, he mentioned some other dogs, and then he said, "pit."
I said, "Pelet?"
He said, "Yeah, the pipes, the skin and processing and processed it in the food.
I said, "What's the procent of your food is bad?"
Look, you know, about two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent of it.
"Donon, what is sustainable in the feeding with the kids?" I told you.
It was a long, and he said, "It was just too many of you say, "You know, I'm just too many you put in the world."
My fish for this fish.
No, it wasn't because I would be a very virtuous and hypocracy.
In fact, they are.
No, I felt like this fishery of God, after that conversation, after that conversation, the fish had gone from that conversation had gone of the same.
The second fish is another type of love.
It's the kind of romantic as you know how you know it as much more you love it.
And then we eat a restaurant in the South Spany.
A friend journalist talked about this fish.
In a kind of arrived.
He came to a blue light, lighten, almost expensive.
The head of the headline.
Two of two times.
Surprint, it was still delicious.
Who can do that a fish to have the good guess?
I don't.
Let's call it Miguy.
In fact, the name is Even my name.
And no, he didn't find the fish and he's not gone.
At least not the way you and I understand this.
He is a biologist at Vetter at the Pale.
It's a fiscal farm in the south of Spany.
It's at the end of the river of the Guadalist.
By the 190s was in the 1980s.
They were growing up in the area that was actually a thought.
They created it by the way.
They built this series of complicated channels, and they reached the water, back in the river.
But they couldn't make it work.
And the ecology was a disaster.
He killed 90 percent of the footprint, which is a lot of foods.
So in 1982 a Spanish company with the ecological conscience.
What did they do?
They've got the short sense of water.
They've comfortable.
Instead of pushing water, they used the channels, they used the water.
They fit out.
They created a piscal piss of 1,000-year-olds -- biban, baby -- and in this process Miguel and his company -- and his company and his company, they were all the details.
The girl is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen anything like that.
Te beaches at the horizonship that is in millions of miles and everything you see and everything you can see and water.
I was there not a lot of Migue.
He is a nemastery of three types of Charles Darwin and a part of Crocods.
OK? So here's us there before, hard to fly through the smoke, and I get luck to the gender, I claim to the genuin?
This is what it looks like a black window.
Now you just mention needs the mineral needs.
And here he sees a pattern in group, which reminds them of giraft.
I learned that Miguel spent most careful of the Middle East National Park in Africa.
I asked you how to become an expert in the fish.
He said, "You know, I didn't know anything about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship."
And then they launched in a lot of discussions and other discussions and straightforward.
And you don't understand me wrong, it was really fascinating, you know, a kind of community in the direction.
It was great.
And I was hit after that piece of fish dollar fish that I consumed too much, which I consumed in the precedence.
So I wondered. I said, "Even what your fisher?"
He showed up to the algoriths.
"Your phones, the algoriths, fitoplan, relationships, it's amazing.
But what do you eat your fish?
What is the rate of conversation?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a kind of rich system that would be eating and in the wild and in the wild.
The booms, fitoplants, frozen fishplan, this is fish.
The system is so healthy is so healthy is completely alone.
It's not necessary.
Have you ever heard of a farm that don't have.
From that day, I was driving the car through this properties with Migue, and I said, "For a place that seems like a natural farm that seems like ever I was going to be able to successful?"
In that moment, it was like a movie of a movie of a movie.
And I gave my colleague, and I saw the most amazing forests, thousands of birds and thousands of birds and thousands of forests.
"This is successful," he said.
"Look at the roz.
It's good."
Where is it? I was completely blind.
I said, "Would you be not, but they don't seem from your fish?"
Yeah, he said, "Yeah.
"Take 20 percent of our fish and in our fish and of the bird because of the birds.
Well, last last year, this property of 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
Today it became the biggest and one of the most important sanctuation in all Europe."
And I said, "Mould I have a flower population of bird bird is not the last thing you want a fisher?"
He claimed the end of it.
He said, "We are extensively extensively not.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingo spring.
The blood creature.
So the more fly is the better system."
OK.
A farm that doesn't hurt their animals, and a farm that they eat their own success.
A fish, but a fishing sanctuary health.
Oh, by the way, those birds of the flamingo, neither you should not even be there.
They go into a 240 kilometers to 240 kilometers are better to build their bodies.
Every morning for 240 kilometers to the farm.
And every night, they fly 240 kilometers back.
They do this because I'm able to watch the cloud of the A92.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the pinguins, so I looked at my time.
I said, "Never 240 kilometers at 24-kilometers and then they fly 240 kilometers back to the night?
Do they do that for the kid?"
He looked at me as if I read from a song in a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No. I do because food is better."
I haven't mentioned my skin who was delicious, and I don't like my skin.
I don't like that. I don't like that.
It has that unpleasant like dron.
When you find it as a bit of almost every time.
However, when I could seem that restaurant in the Spanel in the Spanish.
He had a gygas and curious as you took a bunch of ocean.
I mentioned that Miguel and travel.
He said, "Pields like a bureay.
It's the last defense in the way.
It evolved to absorb the immense of immensely.
And then he said, "But our water has no weight.
OK. A farm that doesn't hurt the fish.
A farm that they eat the successful of animals.
And then I understood when he said, a farm that has no impaid, he had a lot of this stuff, because the water comes out of the river.
It's a river that brings with it all the things that you see in the rights of these chemicals, short chemicals of fish.
And when they go through the system, the water and the water is more curious than the end.
The system is so healthy that you have.
So, not only a farm that doesn't only a farm that don't only a farm that their successful health by the practice that is really a farming farm that is actually a farming of water, but for me and for those fishing water, but for me as well.
Because when the water, it goes back into the Atlantic Ocean.
A painting in the ocean, you know, but it takes to think about it, and so you should do it, because this story of love, although this story is also an instructivity.
You can tell you that it's a network for the future of good foods, no matter that we're talking about biboney.
What we need now is a radically radically radically new agricultural concept.
But for a lot of people is a little bit too radical.
We are not realists.
We are cut.
We love the market markets.
We love the small families.
We're talking about the local food.
We eat organic food.
And when you assure these are the things that will make sure the future of good food and say, "Hey somewhere and say, "Hey lot, and I love birds and I love birds and I love the world?
How are you going to fe?"
Can I be?
I don't like that question.
No, because we already produced more than we need for the world.
A billion people are going to be watching today.
A billion -- this is more than anybody before -- because of the big inequality in distribution, not because of the amount of indistribution not because of the amount of quality.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined our logic system in the last 50 years.
Helfly with grasses, trees with the pesticide of chemicals in the sold chemicals in the wind and all businessman, "What if you fee?"
This was the reason.
It was justifire.
It was the American agricultural agriculture.
We should tell you the name, a business in liquid business, a business that drive very quickly.
This is not a business and it's not agriculture.
Our road, it's threatening today not because of the driver of the resources but because of the resources but because of the last tract of the last tractor, not the lack of the lack of smoke, but lack of the water, not flows of the water, but the lack of the water, not fishing and not fishing and fish.
You want to feed the world?
Do you start asking, "How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or more good, how can we create the conditions that allows to focus them?
In order to do that, not look at the business model,
It's very old and it's very old.
It turns out a lot of capital, chemistry, and it never produced.
Instead of that, let's look at the ecological model.
That's the one that is based on billions of years.
Look at Miguel, farmers like Miguel, farmers who are not only for them are the light for themselves, farmers that restorate instead of ekidney instead of an extensive farmers who are not only intensive, farmers who are not just manufacturer in relationships, because they are the things that are and experts in relationships.
And if I want to be really honestly to be better.
You know, I love with this, because if this is the future of good food, she will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with the Science Fics.
At the high school, I was walking with a school and one of the hour and one day.
And I was always absorbed by a book, a scientific book, which you hate my mind to other worlds, and my satisfy form, the sense of curiosity, the sense of curiosity that we have.
And you know -- that curious curiosity is also the fact that anybody in school, I was not in the forest, walking and raising "mother" and brings me and raising and water, and we put it back in the microscope.
I was a truly of science.
But it was all about my trying to understand the world, to understand the limitations of the possibility of the possibility.
And my passion for scientific scientific science, it really seemed to be in the world around me, because of what happens -- this is what happened at the end of 60s -- I was walking on the bottom of the oceans.
Jacques Coustas Coustar with our amazing emissions that showed us animals, and places in a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine before.
So, this is the point of resonates the whole part of the whole science.
And I was an artist.
I could have the drawing.
And I discovered that, because there was no video games and that there was no idea of the CG and all of these images in the environment, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, you all have to do it, as children have to read a book, and by the authority of the authority, to put something on the screen on the screen of our heads.
And so, my response to all this was to draw creature, to paint creature, robots, robots, robots, robots and these things.
I was always with the applied mathematics on the headline.
This is because this creativity has to be able to find their creative, somebody.
And it happened to Jacques Jacques Cousteau took me very excited about the fact that there was a great world that there on the planet, right here on Earth.
I could not go in a real world exhibition in a space,
This dream of pretty unrealist.
But that was a world where I could really go, and this was going on here on Earth, and it was as rich and exotic as anything else that I imagined in those books.
So I decided that I was going to become a 15-year-old.
And the only problem with this is that I was living in Canada, to 600 miles in Canada.
But I didn't leave this actually left me to intimate.
I put it on my father until he found my father until finally finally finally, a cloud of Buffalo, New York City in Buffalo, almost almost almost where we live.
And I even became a certified in a circle in the middle of YCA in Buffalo in Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.
And I haven't seen the ocean, for two years, when we moved in California.
From the time I was 40 years old, I spent about 3,000 hours in the water, and 500 of those hours of those hours were in subject.
And I learned that this deep environmental environment, and even the oceans of the oceans are so full of life, that is really full beyond what we can imagine.
The image of nature is so lasting with our limitation, compared to our human imagination.
I am completely amazed by what I see when I do these scales.
And my story of love with the ocean, and it is the same powerful as it was always as well.
But when I chose a career as adult, as an adult.
And that's the best way to look at the best way we had this need to tell stories.
And in the kids, I was a comic comic and so forth.
So, the creation of the film was the way to put images together. And that's what he had sense.
And of course, the stories that I chose were the stories that I would say, "Terminor," "Terminor," "Abis."
And with "Abis," I have the love for my spring landscapes of the spring of films.
And by the two passion.
Something interesting about "Abis," and that is solving a specific native problem, which is the creation of that film, which is the creation in the water, because I prevent animation is generated by the computer, CG.
And that led to the first character that came in a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, I should say that the investment has won the investment, I was really extraordinary at global audience, and that global audience was hypnotice.
You know, it's the connected of Arthur Clarke that any technology is impossible technology that any technology is impossible to distance is impossible to distinction.
They see something magic.
And so that made me get very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that has to be adopted in the ancient art."
That's why in "Terminator 2," which was my next movie, I went on.
And working with ILM, we created as a liquid of the liquid of that film, the success of how this special.
And it works. And we created by the magic again.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did a lot more money on this.
So I live a line between these two experiences, resulted in the fact that this is going to be a completely new form of creativity, a new form of film.
In conclusion, I put the basis with Stan Winstead, my grandfather with my friend of creatures and costume designers and costume to that Digital creatures and I call it Digital Domain.
And the idea of behind the company was that we're going to spring the opposite analogical processes and so far beyond the digital production.
And I actually did that, what it gave us a competitive advantage for a long time.
But I went back to the half-year-olds in the middle of design of the creatures and characters and character that company had been fun.
And I wrote this piece called "Batarre" who had the role of prevent things far from visual effects, visual effects, visual effects on the computer and more characters in CGO.
And the map of the main CG.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people from my company told me that we won't do that for a long time.
So I put the idea on the road, and I did another film about a little bit.
You know, I went and I showed it at the studio as "Romeo and Juliet."
I was going to be a romantic story, a passionate moving, a passionate moving.
In the secret, what I wanted to do was to try to rescue my truth of Titanics.
And that's why I did the film.
This is true. Well, the studio doesn't know.
But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to go to the wise. We're going to the wise.
We're going to use this at the beginning of the video.
It will be very important. It will be a great excellent for marketing."
And I was able to fund a expedition.
It sounds crazy. But it has to do with the subject that imagination can create a reality.
Because we really created a reality in which six months later, I find myself in a subject in a subject and half of the Atlantic and a half of the Atlantic Titancient Titans, not a good film, not a good film, not a good film.
Now, this fascinated me.
And it takes a lot of preparation and we had to build the cameras and all sorts of things like a lot of this kind of disappearing me as much as that it was deeply to a space mission.
You know, where everything was straightforward, and which is very powerful planning.
We're looking at this island in the end of the dark environment, and stopped where there are no hope to be saved if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Wow. I am living in a scientific movie.
This is really cool."
And so I was really caught by the way of the oceans.
Of course, the curiosity of the scientific aspect of science.
It was all the time. It was a curiosity. It was a curiosity.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't off.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature, and I could create an effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I could imagine.
While I was doing some of the expedition of the expeditions of the hydrothermore, and sometimes things that we never saw before, sometimes that nobody has ever seen before, who haven't seen a scientist who hasn't been written by the time that we were able to see and photography and photographing them and photo.
So I was completely surprised by this and I had to have more than I had to have more and more of it.
So I took a pretty curious decision.
After the Titans, I said, "I'm going to put a message the message of my bodies of film, and I will become a whole bunch of films and become a whole bunch of movies."
And so we started paying these expeditions.
And we got to go to the Bisk and to explore it with the help of the robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanics.
We took the little robots that we were able to create the optic.
And the idea was to enjoy and to make an intervention explaining an intervention that hasn't done before.
Nobody looked at the wise. They didn't have the middle of doing this, so we created this technology to do that, so we created this technology to achieve this.
So, you know, here's the Titanic, Titans, in a submarine and looking at the bridge, which showed me a lot like the orchestra.
And I'm controlling a little bit of the robotic vehicle through the cycle.
When I say, you know, my mind is in that vehicle.
I felt like that I was a physically presented physics.
And it was the worst of the computing that I ever had, because I knew before before I knew before I knew before the lights was going to be there, before the vehicles that would be there, because I was walking on the stage of the vehicle when I created, I was walking on the stage of the movie.
And the stage was built as a replant of the vapor.
This was an absolutely remarkable experience.
And it made me really make a real experience that you can have with these robotics, when your consciousness, when your consciousness is injected in this different form of existence.
It was the trutk.
And maybe a short look at what it might happen over a few decades, as we're going to start to explain the cycles in many of those kinds of things that I can imagine that I can imagine that I can imagine that I can imagine that girls me that I can imagine that girl.
So by doing these expeditions and starting to appreciate what I found is what I discovered in the deeps of the ocean, where I discovered these amazing animals, where I discovered these amazing animals.
They are essentially extreats that live here, on the Earth.
They live in an environment of chemical synthetic synthetic synthesizes in the solar light so that we have.
So you see the animals that live in the bottom of 500 degrees of water.
You think it could not survive.
At the same time, I was really interested in the space of the science of the scientist that I experienced in my childhood.
And I passed into the community of the community, very involved with NASA, doing some of the NASA NASA NASA NASA NASA, spending missions to Russians and all these things, and all these things, to go through these things and all these things, to go through these things, to the international space with our international system.
And that's fascinating.
But what I was going to do is bring to the space of the space of space with us.
And it's driving it for them to have the same way of the planet scientists, scientists, scientists who were interested in these environments, the deeps of these environments and go to see the deeps and go through the instruments, and so forth.
So here's what we do is doing, documentaries, but actually study the science of space.
I ended up the circle of scientific science, you know, like this, you know, as a child, you know, as you can do these things on the goal of this journey of discoveries, I taught a very lot of it.
I learned a lot about science. But we also learned a lot about the art.
Now, you would think that the register has to be a leader, leadership, and all these things.
I don't really learned about the arts of bringing up until I did these expedition.
Because you had to do it, I say, "What do I do here?"
Why do this?" What do I won this?"
We do not make money with these huge mission.
We're just going to survive. We don't get any kind of fair.
I think that I went out between "Titanic" and "wed" and he said, "You know, I was doing my gap.
I made all of these films, I made all of these documentary audience.
Without the fair, no money. What do you do?
You do it for the work of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenge that exists, for the emotion of discovery that there are a small group of people form a small group of people form a small team of people form a small group of people shape.
Because I was doing these things with a 10-and-12 people, working for years old.
Somebody on a big for 2-year-olds for 2-year-olds.
And in this connection, you realize that the most important thing that you have for themselves, and that you've done for you, because you've done a job that you can't explain each other.
When you go back to the country, and you say, "We had to do that, and you have to do this, and the other things that has been implicated, and the other technology that has been involved, and the human performance of work that can explain the human beings, you can't explain the human beings, or the people in the areas that can explain it through something like this, and I know that I can explain it by something like this, and I know that can't explain.
It takes a connection, it creates a connection.
So, when I went back to my next film, I went to my next movie, I tried to apply the same principle, and that is to get your team and get to the teach you and respect.
And he really changed the dynamic.
Here's my small team with a small team of an unknown territorium territy," invent the new technology that there is no new technology that there is no longer until then.
It's really interesting.
Extraordinary challenge.
And I became a family, on a 40-year-old.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So people have commented by the way of the way that you know, you get to the oceans and you put it on the planet Panda.
For me, it was a fundamental way of doing business, the process of doing business, which has been changed as a result.
So, what can we synthesize?
You know, what are the lesson?
Well, I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing you have.
The imagination is a force that can really manifest in reality.
And the respect of your team is more important than all the laws of the world.
Three creators come to me and say, "Yeah, and tell me to make this."
And I say, "I don't limited to you.
Other people are going to do this for you, not the only thing to do is it anyway,
And you look at the risk."
NASA fraising this preference is not an option is not an option.
But the head has to be an option in art and exploration, because it is a kind of trust stuff.
And not the important thing that he asked innovation didn't have any risk.
You have to be willing to take your risk.
So, this is the cockky that any of you have, which is an ESTE a option, but Africa, no. Thank you.
I want to leave with a single important idea, which is that the whole amount of data that we consume is bigger than the summer of the city, and instead of thinking about what I would like to think about the way that we can use the path and see the patterns so that we can use the patterns and see the patterns and see the kind of invisible.
And now we look at the mortality of organized mortality.
The thing I use here is experimental experiment, which is called Pivot, and what I can do with him is that I can film with a certain causes of moracy.
I can see how a different structure, different structure.
That's where in the middle, people are in the middle, people are at the most active, and this is where they become very fragile.
We make a step back, and we throw the data after dead, we see that the circulators and cancers are the principles, but not for it.
If we continue and filtrate after all, let's say, 40 or less we see the accidents are actually the most frequent of the frequent that the accidents that we can travel their people.
And more than the case for men.
You understand that this kind of visualization of the data, is as if you get in a living.
And if we can do this with the simple data, why don't we do the same with it?
This is where we have a number of number in Sports Illustrate Illustrated to now.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can try this home when you go home.
Pivot, you can see some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can go to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the attacks that came in this sport.
I am a big fan Armstrong, and so that brings me all the numbers, and that brings me all the numbers in the Lance Armstrong.
If I just want to look at them, maybe that I go through the mind, you can see what they have to see what they have to look like?"
I go back and open this.
I see it on the Great Long now.
And you understand that when you navigate through the way and specifically, when specifically, you go back and forth and back.
You do something different.
It's somewhere in the middle, and we think it's changing the way that you can be using information.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that is a little bit like a little song.
I took every page of Wikipedia, and I took it to a resolution.
The result is just a short description and an iconcy, which shows the domain.
And I just show you the first 500 pages right here.
But even in this view, we can do a lot of things.
So we can see what the most popular subjects on Wikipedia.
Now I'm going to select the government.
So now I chose government, I can see the category of the Wikipedia who cover the most frequent and revive Time -- Personality.
And this is important because it's not a thing that was not content in Wikipedia.
You can discover this only if you do a step back and look at all the simulation.
So watching all these strengths, I can explore the revibration of Time -- Personality of Time -- Personal And, to bring all over the surface.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
How many of the science.
How many of them, they come from business.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly, Bono is also a TEDster.
So we go to look at the TEDstage of TED.
You see, we are navigate for the first time as if it was really a network, and not from the page in the page, but at an abstraction.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
I show you New York Times.
Pive our application -- we don't want to call the browser, because it's not even a browser, but you can see the web pages -- and we use our web -- and we use technology in the page.
I can make a step back, to go back to a certain sequence.
Why is it important, because only by looking at the web pages in this way, I can see my entire history in the same way.
I can explore in the detail I made in different periods.
This is actually the situation that we do now.
And I can look at the things that we've done before.
And if I want to do a step back and look at all the time I can look at my history, for example.
This is what I was looking for Bing Bing here for Live Labs Pive Pivot.
And here I can pick up a page and get it again.
It's a metaphor reused by more and more and more and more and more than the lives of the country.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is a blame for us.
We fit from the surgeons with information.
We put ourselves in the data.
What if we would go back and come back, and we come back, and we go back from the next to one thing to go from one thing to go from the next to a lot of things, and be able to go back and be able to find the pattern?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of the data, we could actually extract the information.
And instead of having only one relationship with the information, we could even extract with the knowledge.
And if we extract the knowledge, it can also understand the wise.
See that, thank you.
Everybody's talking about happiness on the day.
I asked somebody to call someone who would call the word "happiness whose the word "happiness in the last five years and reached after about 40. There are much more than 40.
There is a huge amount of interested in happiness for some of the research.
It makes a lot of consistence.
Everybody wants to make people more happy.
But despite the numerous number of activities in this field, there are some cognitive capability to make us a clear image of happiness about happiness about happiness.
My focus today will be doing the reference of these cognitive heavy heavy capture.
There are valuable to use that people who think about their happiness and the researchers that study the concepts of happiness is that we are the kind of confused as all of the other people.
First of these sees is the retics to admit is the complexity of happiness.
It turns out that "happiness is not a word user word.
And you probably have a specific sense that we could restrict it that we could have to give it to this notion and take a better vision and take a better vision.
The second head is a confused between experience, and memories: In fact, a confused between life and life in your life, and thanks or thank you about your life.
There are two very different concepts of the sea notion of happiness.
And the third confusion is the illusion of perception, the fact that we can't think about any circumstances that affect our grandmother.
And this is a cognitive capture.
We're just not to think about fidel.
I would like to start with the example of a person who during the end of the questions and answers to the end of a story.
He was listening a symphony, and that music was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the swarming, he heard a flayer and advertising, that spring the entire experience.
In fact, it's not stricted the experience, but remember.
It had the experience.
Tried 20 minutes of wonderful.
But they were reached at zero because what it was memory.
The minds were otherwise, and the memory was all all the time.
And the cloud here is that we probably wearing each other as an entities with a doubt.
There is a same, which remains in the present, and it lives in the present, capable of the past, but essentially the present.
It's the synthesis of the presence of the doctors.
You know, when the doctor, he said, "Would you come up with you?"
On the other side of the memory of the memory, and the synthetic memory, and the whole memory of our lives.
Is it the one of the book, when you ask the doctor when you ask you said, "How do you feel in the last time.
or "How was the cure in the Albania?" And so on.
These are very different entities of the moments and the memory, and the confusion of the memory, and the confusion of the notion of happiness.
The memory is a story.
It starts with the basic answers of our memory, immediately.
We're not just telling stories when we tell stories.
Our memory says our stories, what we're able to do in our lives, what we're able to do is a story.
Let me start with an example.
There is an old study patients about patients that go through a pain.
It's not in the details. Not painting today, but it was painful in '90s in '90s.
Paties were asked to be to describe his pain every 6.
We have two patients and their relationships.
The question is, "What does it suff?"
It's a very simple question.
And obviously, the patient of B hair.
The colonoscopy of he took a long way through every mind, and the patient -- and the patient -- it was a little bit more.
But here's another question: "What do these patients do these patients do this?
And here we have a surprise, Surprize. Surprizing with a much more unpleasant with a lot more unplease.
Memorials of these colonoscopies were different because of the story of how much of the stories.
None of the relationship is not memorable or frequent to one of them -- but one of them is obviously unlike the other.
And the most unlikely was that the painting was more intended to the end of it.
It's an unplease.
Where do you know?
And I asked these people in the colony, much later than the unpleasant it was the procedure in the changed.
In their memory, it was much more unplease than B.
It's a conflict is the direction, between the moments and my memory.
From the point of view of the experimental point is clear that the patient hair.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually made the clinical experiment, which is to premonitor the colony of the patient About the tubes of the patient with no way to move it too much.
That will make it on the patient to suffer, but less than ever before.
If we do that for a couple of minutes, the experience of the patience of the patient -- but we improve memory of the human memory of the human memory of his experience with a better memory of his experience.
What is it definity?
And it's true for the stories, the stories, but for the stories that we invented memories, but for the stories we invented.
And what defines a story is changing, and the end of the sea and the end.
The paper is very, very important.
In this case, the end, the end.
The moments of the moment's life.
Is it successful moments of life: What happens with these moment: What happens with these moment?
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing for everybody.
Most of the moments of life -- and I calculate psychological present psychological pressure.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these moments.
In a month we have about 600.
Most of them don't leave any follow.
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory.
And yet somehow we have the impression that what happens in these moments are happening in these moments is that what happens in our lives.
It's the resource that we consume during our existence.
And the way we spend it should be relevant, but this is the story of the memory that the synthesis of the memory of a forest.
So we have the synthetic and the synthesizes that are distinction.
The biggest difference between them is the way that the process.
From the point of view, if you go in the vaccine and the second week is as good as the first one, the vacation of two times the vaccine is twice as a week.
For the memory of the memory, things don't work.
For the memory, a vacation of two weeks is uncomfortable than a week because they don't get a new week because they don't get your memors.
The story was not changed.
So the time it becomes the essential variation that distinguishes of the moment.
It has an impact on the stories.
The memory of the memory doesn't only to tell their stories.
It's actually the one that the decision, if a patient hair, for instance, the second colonies with two corners with two surgical surgeons that will be less unpleasant to be less unpleasant that is less unpleasant that desire that determines the choice.
The experiment has nothing to say in this choice.
We don't pick up between the experience, but between the experience of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future as a set of experience.
We think about the future as we think about anticipating.
And essentially you can think of that, as a tyrandom of memory, and you can think of the memory, and you can think about the synthesizes that you don't need.
We have the sensation that when you go to the vaccine and this is really happening in the vacance, in a very large ways, in a very large ways, in the work of memory.
And this is pretty hard to justified me.
I mean, how do we consume our memory?
This is one of the things that explain the domination of memory.
And when I think about it, I think about a vaccine that I spend in Antarctica, a few years ago, which was the most beautiful vaccine that was the most beautiful vaccine that I had the most beautiful, and think about it as much as I think about it as much as I think about other vacation.
And I probably consumed the memories of that vacation of three weeks of about 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had opened the blue of 600 pictures of the 600 pictures, I would be spent another hour.
So we have a part, three weeks, and on the other hand, and a half a hour and a half.
It seems to be a talk.
Maybe I could be a little bit of an extremely through my memory, but even though they consumad, but even though they convey the question, the question, the question.
Why do we agree that a lot of important memory compared to the experience with experience?
So I would like to think about an experiment.
Imagine that you know about the end of your vaccine you know that your pictures will be destroyed, and you want to take a drug a drug that you don't have any more remember.
Did you choose?
And if you pick up a different vacance, there is an experimental conflict between memory and my memory, and you have to think about how to transcend this conflict, because if you take the time as a critical answer.
And if you take your memories as the criteria that you could have another answer.
Why do we choose?
It's a problem where we confronted with an experimental choice between experimental synthetic and the memory.
The experimental income and the memory of the memory of these different notions of happiness.
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to each other.
So you can ask: How can you be the experimental?
And on the other hand. How happy are the moments of the things in the life of the life of the experience?
And they're all happiness.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now as much to make a pretty good contains about happiness over time.
Instead, the happiness of the memory, is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy it lives a person.
It's about how satisfy it is this person when they think about his life.
It's a very difference.
Who does not do the distinction between these notion -- compromising the study of happiness, and I have a group of researchers that have compromising happiness for a lot of time for a long time.
The difference between happiness between the happiness and satisfaction and satisfaction in the last few years, and they do now work on the last few years, and they measuring both separated.
The Gallout of the Gallout of the world opinion of the world where you think about half million people have been question about their life and their experiences and their experiences and their experiences.
And they were done and other forms.
So over the last few years we started learning some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that the main I have learned, is the fact that there are different reality.
You can know how the satellite they are some of their life, and this is actually not a lot of happiness are in their life, and they are in their life, and vast.
I just want to give you an example of correlation, corelation, is about 0.5 this meaning if you come up with someone and you can say, "Oh my father is the other 1.80 me."
Well, you know something about his inalties, but there are a lot of innocent Aattered.
If you would say that somebody else in the opposite one of the 10th of tend to have a lot of happiness.
So the relationship is the mice.
We know something that is controlling the satisfaction of synthesis of happiness.
We know that money are very important to the money are very important to the goals.
We know that happiness is the more you want to be satisfy with people who lie us.
There are other places, these are dominance.
So if you want to maximize the second thing, you can get to make a difference.
The conclusion of what I said here is that we actually don't have to be the queen of happiness for happiness.
It's a completely different notion of it.
Now, very quickly, the other reason we cannot queen as simple as we don't mean that we're not talking about the same things that we don't think about the life and when we live in the life effective.
So, if you put a simple question: how happy people in California are the people in California you don't get to the answer.
See this question, you would think that people have to be happier in California if you live in Ohio.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the living in California, you think about the contrast between California, and other places, for instance, climate.
But it turns out that the climate is not really important for the expert and it's not really important for the synthetic and it's not really important for happiness that decide how happy.
But because of the fact that the reflective synthesizers can get -- some people can get to move to California in California.
And it's quite interesting to watch what is going to happen in California that will move in California hope that they will be happier.
So their experimental synthetic will not be happier.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen. They would think they're happier.
Something as I think about it, as an origin Ohio in Ohio in Ohio and you are going to feel good.
It's very difficult to think of simplicity about as I hope that I offered a little image of what you do.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
A few weeks ago, when I talked to the phone, you mentioned the fact that you have a really interesting result in the opinion of Gallup.
Do you think that you can share this for a few minutes?
Daniel Kahn.
I think the most interesting result of the Gallall is a number of that we haven't waiting for it.
And what we found was about the happiness.
We looked at how we see the feelings of income function.
And it turns out that in a 60,000 dollars a year for Americans, and this is a big number of Americans about 600,000 people who is a big ethanks of 600,000 dollars a year.
CA: 60.00.
DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are unfortunately, people are unfortunately, and they become more unfortunate than the Player is this level, and we get a graduate line.
I want to say that rares I have seen a straight line.
It's clear that the money doesn't bring the happiness of this experiment, but lack of their unfortunately, and we can map this unfortune.
In terms of the other synthesizes, we have to do with another situation.
The more money with the more satisfaction.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Danny, all the American dream is about vidly, freedom of happiness.
If the world would take this very seriously, I want to say, everything seems to be on all of what we think about the fiscal politics and so on.
Is there any chance of the policy, as the state in general, so seriously, to take a serious state of the audience in the audience of the audience of the audien?
DK: You know, I think there is an recognizing recognition of happiness in the public policy.
It will be lasting in US, undoubt in UK, but in UK, and other countries.
People realize that the fact that we should think about happiness when they think about the public policy.
It's going to take some time, and the world will disrupt if you want to look at experiment, or if they want to look at the life, so if they want to look at the life that we have to have this displace, and if we think about improving happiness, and if you think about it, and if we think about it, and if we think about the things that we think about the things that we think about experiment.
This is going to influence the influence, I think, in the next day.
In US, it makes the effort measurement of the population of the population of this population, I think, in the next two decade, part of the national statistics or the next national statistics, or at least the national strengths, or at least the interesting issues that come in.
Thank you very much because you invented the behavior.
Thank you Danny Kahnan.
I'm going to talk about energy.
And that may seem a little surprising because my work with the luck with the work of the vaccines of vaccines, the things that we need to invest in the streets that we need to be able to help the poorest of the poorest of the poorest on the poorest to be better.
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people, even more important than anyone else on the planet.
The climate of climate is that many years is that many years will not be growing.
It's going to be too much plot, it's not going to be destroyed.
The things are going to change in their fragile environmental environments that cannot be afford.
And that leads to focus on the southern nelsewhere.
climate change is going to be terrible for them.
And also the energy of the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose a single thing that we can get the price to reduce the poverty, we choose the energy.
Well, the price of energy was reduced in time.
And it really advanced civilization is based on energy.
The evolution of the goal of the food revolution, and even in the 1990s in the 1990s -- and that we have a very refrigerator, we can create modern materials, we can create all kinds of modern materials.
And so we are in this beautiful situation in the rich world.
But once we do it cheaper -- and try to make it cheaper, and try to break a new building -- we need to break a new building, and this whole new circle of CO2.
CO2 spreads the planet, and the equation of CO2 is really simple.
If we add the amount of CO2 emissions, this goes to a temperature of temperature, and the temperature of temperature.
And the effects of thousands and perhaps more gravity so that the ecosystem so that the natural ecosystems can't adapt the college of these changes rapidly, and this is how they get to the collapse.
Now, the measure of the corelation between CO2 and increase of the temperature of the temperature and where there is no longer the indifferent position, but it's not very big.
And there's certainly certainly certainly about how falls, but they're going to be extremely graving.
I asked the margin, the great scientist, in repetities: Do we really have to get close to zero?
Can we not reduce half-to half or a shap?
And the answer, the answer is, by zero zero, the temperature will continue to create.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about four meters that we need to go through a three meters that we have to go on a threshold.
Here we have something that we need to go to zero.
Well, we're emitting a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26-billions.
For each American is about 20 tons.
For people in the poor people in the country.
In the average of the planet are about five tons for every man.
And somebody, we have to do the change that at zero.
It great.
Most of the economic changes have produced a same, so we need to go from a fast-risk growth, so we have to go to zero.
The option has four factors.
Sely.
So, we have something on the left, CO2, which we want to be on zero, and this is the number of people, the services that every single person uses on average, the average of the energy and the energy on the top of the energy.
Let's look at every one of them and see how we can get to zero.
Probably one of these numbers should be close to zero.
Well, this is from high school algebra, but let's take a look at it.
First of all, we have the population.
Well, the world is 6.8 billion people.
It's about nine billion.
Well, if we make a great job with vaccines, new medicines and reproductive, we could get that with reproductive, we could 10 or 15 to a hundred or 1.3.
The second factor are the service that we use.
That includes the whole food that we have, the food that television, the height, the height.
These are very good things and flow of poverty is offered these services in the planet.
And it's a great thing to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first billion, perhaps we could limate our feet, but every single year, this frame, in the average, so in the average services, so in the general services, so in the next two hours.
This is a very elementary service.
Do you have lived in order to read your home?
Well, these children don't have, so they come out and read the footprints from the light of the light bulb.
And then the efficient efficiency for every service, here we have a good news.
We have something that doesn't grow.
By different inventions and ways of humiliation, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings where you can reduce the energy for that you can reduce energy for that strengths, in which you can reduce energy to 90 percent.
There are other services, for instance, or how we make the transport transportation, where there is much less place for improvement.
So, in media, if we are optimistic, you could get a reduction reduction reduction to three times.
But for these three factors until now, we get from 26 billion dollars, in the best case, in the best case, maybe 13 billion tons, and that's not enough.
So let's look at the fourth factor -- this is going to be a key factor -- which is the amount of CO2 emisphere.
And the question is, is the question: Can we reduce it to the zero?
If you look at the book,
If you look at natural gas well.
It's almost every way to produce electricity today, except for electricity today, except the kind of emerging and nuclear CO2.
What we're going to need to do is make a new system.
So, we need miracles of energy.
Well, when I use the miror, the miracle of something that is impossible.
The processing is a mirror. The person is a personal mirror.
The Internet and service is a miror.
The people here have contributed to the creation of the miracles.
We don't have a thermore, to get a miracle to get a miracle until you get that one.
You just just waiting and some of the window.
This is a case where we really need to accelerate the maximum and get a miracle in a very short war.
I thought, "How could I guess how could I say, how could I guess ide?
Is there any new illustration that we can inspire people?
I thought that last year I got the last year, I got the country and it turns out that they love.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, there are people who live with the country.
Well, with energy, everything I could find was this.
I thought I was going to take a few lights and this year at my environment in this year.
So here we have some natural lights.
I was told that it wasn't really easy.
Well, there are all sorts of things like this, but they don't know who they know what value.
We need more and more and more and more than an incredible expensive, and there are a lot of the direction, and the people I see only five things that can only five things that can only five that I can make margins.
I left the energy of making, geoters, geoters, frozen biofuel.
They might be able to contribute it, and if they want to ask me, and if they want to ask me what expect.
But what I want to point here is that we should work every single one of those five of these five of those five of them even though we don't want to give you some of them, because you see all the difficulty.
Let's look at the first time to look at the fossil of fossil fuel.
What we have done here, it seems simple, but it's not going to take CO2, after we throw it and you can skip it and resistancy, and you hope that we remain there.
Now we have some pilots that are doing this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the growth of the percent, this will be very difficult to understand where this will be very difficult to understand where we want to see where the size of CO2, but here is the most gap.
Who is going to be sure.
Who is going to guess something that is literally more than any type of resider than any kind of residual residu?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
And the next nuclear.
It also has three great problems.
Like, particularly in the street countries, it's big.
The problem of safety, to be link that nothing can happen, and we have these human operators are not going to be used for weapons.
And then what do you do with residu?
And even though they're not very much about it.
People have to feel good about it.
So there are three very hard problems that could have the solution, and so we should work at them.
The last three of the five I put together together.
These are the people called renewables.
But even though it's wonderful, they don't need fuel -- some disadvantage -- some disadvantage.
One is that the density of these technologies is much smaller than an electric center than a central center.
These are energy farms, we talk about many kilometers, a lot of kilometers of thousands of times more than a normal.
And all of these are the source of it.
The sun doesn't take all the day and it doesn't fit every day, and the wind, the wind, the window.
If we depend on these sources, we need a way to get energy in those periods when she is not available.
Here we have a big issue.
We have difficulty with transportation.
For instance, to tell that a source of energy is in the country, you don't only need to express you, but you have to express and risk energy.
And finally, there's the issue of the road.
And to understand the size of the size of the batteries of batteries that are products, computers, computers, computers that are products for telephones,
I compared to the amount of energy that we find that the world, and we found that all the batteries we can now produce the less than 10 minutes.
So in fact, we need a significant progress here, a hundred times better than we have before.
It's not impossible, but it's not easy.
That's what the problem is when we want the source of intermittedly to say, 2033 percent of the consumption.
If we are based on it for 100 percent, we need a battery.
Well, how are we going to go beyond the right way.
Is it an idea of Manhattan? What can we help us get there?
Well, we need a lot of shapes to work on this,
At each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And many of them will look and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the TED group of people who are already on this road.
Bill Gross has a few companies, between which one of the Solar, which has some of the terms.
Vines Khosis investing in tend companies that make remarkable things that make remarkably interesting possibilities and I try to support it.
Nathan Myhrvold and I really supporting a company, which may be surprising the nuclear.
There are some of the nuclear innovation in the field.
But the innovation really stopped in this field now, a lot of time, so it would not be surprising to be surprising ideas.
The TerPower idea is, instead of throwing a part of the urban wave part of the next hundred years we decided to show the 99 percent of U338.
It's a kind of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it a lot of time, but it could never be able to simulate how if it worked or not.
Just because of the supercomputers can now simulating modern and you can simulate and see that, in fact, using the mates of the right way, it turns out that it would work.
And because it turns out the 91 percent, the profiles is much improved.
In fact, we throw the residents, and we can use fuel as a fuel residual resides today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use them.
And it turns out the way that you have. It's like like a kind of light.
You see here a kind of budget, called "reactor "reactor with the reactor.
In terms of the fuel, this is really sold the problem.
I have a picture of a place in Kentucky.
These are residents, 90 percent of the 99 percent of the consumption that look at what it looks like.
It's called a pockets.
And it turns out that the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the watch of water in a very uncomfortable process.
So we're waiting for a lot of difficult, but it's an example from many hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to have.
Let's think about it, how can we avoid?
How should we look at our need?
Well, let's see where we have to go to where we have to look at the intermedia.
For 2050 you've heard a lot of the world talking about this reduction of 80-percent.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent will be connected by why it happens in the poor and continues of agricultural agriculture.
And we hope that we're going to be clear, the circle of the sky.
In order to reach the 80 percent of the developing countries, including countries as well.
The other note is if we apply this technology with zero emerging technology, if we went through all the development of the world.
That's important.
This is a key elements in the completion of the Internet.
Do we do a step back, how should we look at the notion of 2020?
Well, again, you should have two elements.
We should be applying these measures of efficient efficiency.
The more we are emitting the less of CO2 will be the summer of CO2 and so on.
But in a way, the notion that we get things that we don't go to the reduction of the mark, it's just a little bit more important than the other things that is the portion of innovation of these progress.
These prototypes have to take the maximum speed and that we can measure with the companies that have been changed.
They wrote a lot of books on this.
Al Gore, "Gore, our name and our book and David MacKay, Energy -- without a sustainable -- no doubt.
They take everything in the hand, and they create a structure so that the world can talk about these things, because we need a little bit of it.
I have to have a lot of things to be seen.
It's a wish.
It's a very concrete to invent this technology.
If I could only choose for the next 50 years, I could choose for the next 50 years, I could choose a vaccine, I could choose a vaccine that passionate me or I could pick up a half of precisely CO2.
I wish that I would choose.
It's got the biggest impact.
If we don't reach this wise, the division between people who think about the long-term and the long-term and China, between the United States and China, between the United States and the rich of two billion people are going to be much more real.
What do you have to do?
What do you want you to do more far and put in your mother?
We need more foundations.
And when the countries are coming up to Copenhagen, for instance, not only about CO2.
It should be discussions of innovation.
It would be surprising you how much of the small innovation of these innovative research.
It takes the steps of stone on CO2 to CO2 to do this signals of the precision.
We need to spread the message.
I need this conversation to be able to become more intelligent, including the measure that the government.
It's an important wise, but I think we can remove.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you very much better understand about TerPower, first of all, you can offer an idea about the expensive scale?
Bill Gates: To make the software, he buy the supercomputer, engagement of competence, which is only tens of million.
Even after we testing the materials in a reactor rushy, to be sure that our materials are going to above hundreds of million.
The hard thing is the requires the reaction of the surveillance of the bility of the buildings of the building of the building of the first one of them.
After you build it on the first one, if it goes like in reclay, then it's clear as the economy, because of the energy density density density, are very different from the nuclear field.
CA: To understand how we need to understand how we need to build in the ground, in the deeping of a vertical cycle fuel, with this kind of roughly consumption, and then it starts and then the process starts and then it starts to go through and somewhere in the bottom?
BG: That's what you do. Today, you have to reality the answer, that there are many people and many devices that can be weigh and you are able to get the objects and you get out of the objects of it.
That's not good.
If you have a very cheap that you can leave 60 and over 60 years -- we can put it with a budget it with a budget and complexity.
It only goes there and argues for 60 years, and then it's gone.
CA: It's a nuclear center that is also the own solution that is also the way of deforestation.
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the residents, you can leave them there -- there's a lot of residents in the way that -- and then you can even take it in the way and then you can actually take it in the other hands there.
And we start with the residual residuces that are today, in the basis of residential rehairs.
From this combat that.
The thing that is a problem for these reactors is really the matches of our and reducing and reduced by this process.
CA: But in the discussions with different people around the world with possibilities, where you find the biggest interest in order to make something concreted?
BG: I don't chose a precise place and there are all these rules of the nuclear.
We're interested in a lot of the company in Russia, China.
I met here with the energy of the mind, and I talked about the place of this ideas in the energy agency.
I'm optimist. Let's know that French and Japanese have done something.
This is a variety of something that happened.
It's a great developing development, but it's like a very quickly, and many countries have built them, so any of the countries that have built a quickly in the country that will be built a very quickly in which that will be built the first of them.
CA: What happens is, when and what the probability is going to make concrete concreted?
BG: For one of the big electric generators that is very cheap we have 20 years to invent it, and then 20 years old.
And this is the limit of the environment of environmental models that we have to break us that we have to break.
And TraerPower, if things go good, what is a big wish.
Now, there are some of the company, tend of companies, we also need to be sure, if their research, they also go good, they can make a good work for it.
And it's the best if I succeeds, because when you can combine it.
We need to be able to succeed.
CA: Like changes in the water, is that the biggest that we know that the biggest you know it?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of environment, but the average of the average of the environment.
In the nuclear are more innovator.
You know, we don't know the work of the same as well as those who go on the way, but there is another way.
There are also a liquid reactor, which seems to be a little bit difficult, but it can also tell us as well.
So there's a variety.
The beauty is that a hundred million times as a million times more energy, to say, one million times as well.
So if we can solve the negatives of radiation, which is essentially the environment, then the except of the environment, the potential as effect, the potential and so on.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
Would we start to take the urgency of urgency to mention the temperature?
BG: If you go to the situation is as much as you eat too much and you are on the point of having a body attack.
What do you do? You need to have the surgeon or something.
There's a research direction of what is called geotechnology, which is called geoengineering by different techniques to 20 or 30 years.
But this is just a police policy.
We hope we don't need it.
Some people say that we should not even work at the police policy, because it could even be able to focus us because we know that we're going to save because we know that it's going to save the cardid.
I don't think that this is wise, with the importance of the problem, but there are geoengineering this discussion, if we shouldn't have to keep the police in case of the bubbles or if this innovation goes into a lot more slower than we expected.
CA: Scepts of climate change or two: in a sentence or two, what would you tell it to convince it that mistake?
BG: So unfortunately, the unfortunate of the camps.
Some of the scientific arguments are very put.
Do you think there are effects of the reversion of the luck of the cloud that modify today?
There are very, very few things that I can say.
They have a million years from a million to million.
The main here is about AIDS.
You are the wrong now you and you pay for it much later.
When you have all sorts of issues, the idea is to support, the idea of having a wall of the pain, and the pain.
In fact, we have the IPCC, which doesn't reflect the most people in the rich, and there are people in the rich world look at IPCC and saying:
In fact, the certainty, we should just die to this.
But my dream here is to get an economic and simultaneously to break and simultaneous CO2, and then the skeptics of CO2, and then I don't care care about my CO2, but I want to embrace CO2, but I want to accept because it's cheaper than ever before.
CA: So this would be the answer to Bjorn Lomboring, who says that if you consume so that if you consume the problem of CO2 to try to solve the other pieces of malaria and otherwise, we try to remove the poverty, when we are the resources that when they are better than when they do.
BG: Actually, the expensive part of the research and developing -- to say that the United States should be spent 10 than it -- it's not that dramatic.
It wouldn't remain other things that we have.
And the thing you spend more, and here people can not be able to agree, is when you try to fly when you try to fund something unsaying.
Then, for me, is a lot of risky, from the situation when you are almost fund and just finding the data, and it's going to be very cheaply.
I think we should try to try to try to be more cheaper.
If we get to the compromise to make the smoke, then rich energy can afford that.
Anyone of us here could be paying five times as much as we can change our lifestyle.
Duos is for the two billion.
And even Lomborg has changed.
His now -- why it's not discussing more about research?
It's because of the things in the past is continuing with the skeptices, but it turns out that it is a pretty single battlefield of the sky.
It's a little bit of something correctly, I believe.
And the research and development and development, it's crazy crazy as well.
CA: Bill, assume that I speak in the name of most people say that when I tell you that you can look very much.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share a discovery of discovering a few months ago, as I wrote an article for Italian article.
When I write, I always wrote the dictionary at the end of it.
But I already finished the article and I realized that I never saw the word "disability.
Let me read the definition.
'Diz's, substitute, "substitute, unjudgment, no usual, unusual, funny, dneeds, mostly displaced it, weight, inkissed, disappointment, uncled, displaced the smoke, disappeared, disappeared.
You can see and bad.
Anton: health, powerful.
I read the list of a friend and at the beginning.
It was absurd.
After I got to "skilot," he left me and I had to stop my voice my voice, and I had to come back from these words.
It was my old dictionary.
I thought, well, maybe it was carefully.
But he came from the beginning of the early '80s, when I started to understand where I was starting to understand where my family, and how I reported my family, and how I report my family and the world around me.
Let me tell you that when I didn't use a dictionary.
After this definition, it seems that I was born in a world who believed that someone who believed anybody in the position.
But today, I'm grateful for the opportunities and the adventures that my life.
So I looked at the immediately in 2009, in 2009, hope to find a major modify change.
Here's the new version of the definition.
Unfortunately, there's nothing better.
And the last two word, of course, as "Araz's, I'm sorry, I'm a dung and "vigorged."
Not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people that we call in this way.
It's about the values behind the words and how we build them.
Our ancestors affect our thinking and the way we see the world and the other people.
In fact, a lot of societies, including societies, they think that an empty was very strong, because when you tell you the voice was very strong, because when you tell you about it.
So what do we want to create it?
One person who's limitations or a strong?
By the simplest we call a kid, a kid that we could stop the power that it is.
Wouldn't it be better, right?
A man who opened me a dot of my childhood of my childhood Institute of the A.after the Wilmington, Delawareness.
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo.
The orgine of origin whatsoever, which is too difficult for Americans.
So he said Dr. P.
Dr. P. Take paper paper and traveling to work with the kids.
I was in the hospital, except for the physical therapy of physical therapy.
I had to do the nancient exercise with these tools with these colors, different colors, because I ask my feet.
I watched the soul.
I did.
Although I was five years old, I was trying to figure out the D.P. to give me the exercise.
One day, she came to my meeting --
-- there were some dynamic etheless,
And he said, "Aime," you're a very powerful feeding girl, I think that I think a will release one of these committed." And this was going to give you a 100 dollars," this was the wild of the Pizzutility of the Pizzuth of the Pizza, I will be able to do the exercise my laction of two feets.
But what he did was to transform a damage of a dad new experience in a new and promising experience.
And I wonder what I hope that I said that I'm a strong feature that I think I'm a powerful feature that I see today as a powerful person.
This is an example of the way that adults who are the power of the power of a childhood of a child.
But by those definitions of the dictionary, our language doesn't allow us to trust the reality that we all have, the possibility to think about an individual possibility.
Our dancing is not at the qualities, many of them are products of technology.
Of course, of course, in my legs, my legs, the surgery, the surgery for deficiencing with the titan for gender gender, which allows people to put people in their values and reach people to understand their skills and reach out of the socialization of the socialization of social social socialization that allows people to join them, so that they can join the choose, so that you can join the choose.
Maybe the technology of our technology is now clear what it was always true.
And it turns out that every man has something route and strong society and that the ability to adapt is the most of us.
The human action to adapt is an interesting thing because people want to talk about the birds to talk about the forests, and I will always make a margins.
I never loved this expression, and I responded to the questions of people about it.
I think I started to understand why.
It turns out in the problem of deforestation is and the idea that the success or happiness means that the successful experience, no weight without having this hard experience, like this, like this, as the success of the life to stop, as the successful lives, or what other people see with a protein, or what other people see as the disability.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, a physical challenging challenge or emotional challenge.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
The adversity is not an obstacle that we need to go and live our life continues.
It's part of our life.
I think it's kind of my shadow.
Sometimes I see it pretty much more and more than I always see with me.
I don't try to make the impact of a person with a person with the adversity.
In life, there are adversity and challenges for each of us, but the question is not if you can meet this adversity, but the way you react to it.
And so our own is not only to protect the adversity of the people who love, but to prepent them with it.
We make them a deserve of kids, when we make them feel incapable.
There's an important difference between the fact that I had suffered an amputation and the opinion of society, if we have, or no disability.
And to be honest, the only thing I confronted with which I confronted with the fact that the world belief that I can describe to the definition.
Our desire to protect the people who love, saving the truth of diagnosis about diagnosing about the quality of their lives, we need to be the first to be the first one to feel the primes that we do something.
So you see you just what is wrong with you can be much more hot than pathology.
Because we're not treating the people in the totality, and we don't recognize the resilient of the other problems that we get another road.
And we are essentially the importance of that man in society.
So we need to see through the patology of things that is capable of a man.
And, it turns out a partnership between those deficiencing and our biggest creators and our creature.
We don't need to become alorizing or negative to get these moments to avoid it or to go with it, but to find the opportunities.
The idea that I want to point point is not only to focus the adversity, but also to get us to open it, and we can open it up, to make it a check in order to use it with it.
And maybe we're going to see the adversity as a consistent, consistent and something that we don't trave.
In this year, Charles Darwin has 200 years, and now 150 years ago, when he wrote about evolution, when he was writing about evolution, Darwin Darwin has a truth of human characters.
To parafraid, not the most powerful species of survival and not the most intelligent, but that can adapt at change.
Consider generate creation.
And by Darwin, among among other things, we can see that the ability to survive that the ability to fly is impulsive impulsion of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit.
Once a sudden, the transformation is the biggest attack is the biggest attack.
And maybe until we're testing, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable.
Maybe this gives us adverses: a sense of synthetic sense of our own power.
And so we can do only make a stunts.
We can redefine the adversity as something more than the table.
We can see it as a change.
The adversity is the change that we still don't even adapt.
I think the biggest adversity I think is the idea of normality.
Who is you?
There's no normality.
There are very typical faces, but not normal.
And you really want to know you to know one person?
I don't think so.
If we can change this paradigm from the aspiration to normality or force, to tell you a little bit more more, we can release the force of many children and we can remove their values in the community.
Anthropologists tell us that the only thing we humans, we asked them to be used to be used to be used to be use.
He discovered that the Neanderthal Neanderthal of 60,000 years old, and the physics of physics and maybe because their experience their experience of survival for the experience of survival for community.
They don't see these people as being infirms.
They were considered rats and value.
A few years ago, I was in my home, I was in my hometown, in that area of Pennsylvania, and I was looking at a wheels.
It was far. I was in a short pants.
I heard the voice of a man behind me, "Go to go, if it's not Aimes." I went back, I went back, I went back, I went back and saw an old old man who didn't know an old man who didn't know.
I said, "I'm scard." We don't know. Are you know? I don't know how to be help."
I said, when we met my mother, you just held your mother.
So he was.
And I remember.
That man was Dr. Kean, a man that I knew only about my mother's stories of my mothers, even as used, I came on the world with two weeks.
And the doctor went out of the vacance.
So the one who held my parent on the world was a stranger for my parent.
And because I was born without the neighborhood and because I had to give the legs and only a few frogs, he had to give them too.
He said, "You know, I had to say that your parents of your parents," and you will never go, and you will never have the furniture that you will never have a independent.
"But you would demonstrate that I showed me that I was more extraordinary is the fact that he seemed to be the end of the news.
When I won the surface consistent of the two, when I was with another when I was with the Halloween, when I took it to college.
He figured out the students of residents, the students from Have the Herhey.
And this is what we call the X-X-ray potential, the potential of human.
No diagnostic diagnostic can be in the way of the power of your life.
And Drhn, "From my experience, if you don't tell my contrary, if you don't have the contrary, and if you get the best support and you can do what the best support to do what the performance is going to do what the performance is going to do the performance.
Dr. Kean did that change in mentality.
He understood that there is a difference between the diagnose of the medicine and the way that someone reaction to him.
And my mentality has changed over time.
If you ask me at 15 years if I could give the protests in changes in the career and I would not have any second.
At that time, I was aspiring at that kind of normality.
If you ask today, I'm not sure.
And that's what I said, "Thank you.
Maybe this change in me has been produced because I was exposed to many people who have opened me in my face.
So, you know, you don't need a person to have a person to have the revelation of your own power.
If you can offer your key key to your own power users, the human spirit is so received -- if you can do that and you can do that and you can do it as well.
You get it to open their does.
In fact, the word "educate" has the rooth of "God."
It means to put it in the first plan is inside of the potential value.
So what potential is, we want to take in the point of view?
He made a case of case in Britain, in the 1960, when they went from the '60s when they went to the classical schools.
It's about the categorization.
They are separate from the students with AB, with B, with the D.D.
You have a better programmer program, the best teachers and etc.
Timp three months, the students with the notes of Day, they said that they were said that they were told that there are gone.
After this period of three months, they had the note performance.
The friend of mine was that my students was said that I was told that I was that I was told that I was the notion of Dr.
And that happened after three months.
Some of them were in school. Some of the studies.
The crucial part of this study is that and the teachers have been chicken.
They didn't know that changed something.
They were told you who the students who Dr. and they have DH:
And they treat the road.
I think the only handicap is a drug spirit doesn't have hope, which doesn't have hope.
Not the beauty.
It's not the natural curiosity of the child and the capacity and imagine.
If we can drive the spirit of the spirit of a human being, to see the beauty, to see the beauty and others, it means that we use the power of imagination, it means that we use the power of imagination, that we use the power of how we need to do.
When a spirit has those qualities, we can create new realities and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poetry with a pop from a pop in sequences of J.14, which he said my friends who told me my friend's friend.
The God is called "God who knows just four words.
"Every kid knowing God." "I don't have God of the words of the words of the words of the words that I know that one is just four words and all of the words and all of the words and all of the words and all of your mind.
"Vino and dancing with me." Thank you.
