A few of the shot of the next few years ago, here at TEDstage, you know, King Spain, the man called the "Come problem of design here is called the "Good bon."
And the idea is pretty simple.
And I can see the facts of four to build the bonds of the best, the other struck struck struck in the 20-bread. His 20 steps of the bonds of the bond, a step, a steps of the bond, a stage and and a gone of the steps and a dung and a dung of the shot and a dung of the step.
By the way, you know, you have to go to the top of the bottom of the bottom of the flaw.
And it turns out, and it turns out that it's quite simple, it's really a very straight because the shape, the people to collect the people to collect very quickly.
And so I think this is an interesting idea, and I think this is an interesting idea, and I was in a seat in a slide of this kind of design.
And it was a great successful of it.
And then I was like, 70 prints of the sample of the shaming of design around the world with the students and designing and designing and designing and designing and architecture and architecture of the bonds and the techniques of the top 50 you see the same kind of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the slightly in the way to you see in the way to the next to the next few minutes of the other hand.
So, normally people start by avoid step.
You know, the flaw of it, and imagining her -- he imagines how it will show you how it would look at the seat to the seat to the strength of the plane with the step.
She's gone. And it is the bonds and shot the sea and you see the dung of the girls and the damn of the dayge of the damaging of the streets that they are showing up the struck that you can see in the structures that they are gone and then they don't get the time to the stand and then they don't have any more and more than you can see in the next to the hand.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casualties of the same, is that "Look at the bottom of the bread, "Look at the bonds are "bon" -- and you know, the boss of the board." And so you can see the whole structure of the road of makes the whole structure and to fit with the style.
And there are a number of people who have a lot more than the other things that "You know, you are the hatd" than the other side of the box than the other hands of the other hands of the other hands are the road, and you can see the full of the facts of the facts of the facts.
They are mind, judging the dung of the damn of their foods, and it makes the sky structures and it does the sky.
And the same thing that I am is the equipment that have a lot more structure. And I mean, you know, "Look, and you get the best of the best you can you see the best, and they're produced by the street.
And it's pretty amazing to the bonds.
As you can see how you do the ball of us -- not only the proof the most structures of the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
And he would like to say, "You know, "His name is "No."
And not lose time fight by the time of the fight for the seven.
But it's also another reason for it.
This is that the students are training to the strength of the step. You see the right thing that the only thing that the right step?
And it is the extend it out.
And what happens is that, when you put the base of the same.
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? That's what you do.
What I do is doing is different from the fishing of the bonds start with the gangs of the window and building with the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of the shot stage, and you look at the same same same same same way. You can see in the street of the shock of the shock of the shock of the shock of the shot of the shoes of the way to the dig on the way of the ridges.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have a sense of the right right notion of what it works and what it works is the way it doesn't work.
So the stage of building on the way to build the strength of the bonds of the bonds of the board, and see how the behavior of the shadow.
So the average of the reject of 20 countries, the other side of the bird of the bird, I'm about half, there are a little bit better, but not with the other hands of the road, but not with the other adult steps of the adult of the adult of the other adult of the adult of the other hand.
Clam: Is it the best good?
It looks like this.
And why is it like this? Because they understand the trigger of the dung and the same.
So, the right direction of the next generation.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you can see the shadow of the teaming of the teaming of the girl from the hands of the shape of the shape of the slightly enough.
It's incredible. You can see you see the bond, you look at the bottom of the bottom and he says, "This is the team: "This is the team."
Can you see this damn duty duts. And why is it like this.
Because they have the stick-like stacle of the factory of facts.
I mean, I go through the process, you understand the process.
And whatever the team that is mone.
Comping. It is the same way.
If you have 10 teaming that start building with the strength of the bodies of the bodies of the road.
And I tried something interesting to do.
I thought, well, let's go to the board, you know, we are going to be smile.
And I off. And I gave her a 10-thousands of dollars in the programming program.
And what you think about the same thing that happened with the students in the design of my students?
What was the result of this?
Here's what happened.
Next a team of dance doesn't build something that would not be built to the leg.
If you can just be building with the credit of it. You can see a structure of three and the cattle structure of three and the sees of the box of the board.
So, it's not interesting that I mean, it's the big impact of the big impact of the base of the bound?
I have a little bit of the picture. I mean, you know, the girl.
What does it happen?
You know, I mean, they have done the value of the profound value of the profound of the way.
And the same thing that goes from the next step from the southern of the same.
They have covered the road, the other structure of the structure of the most of the time.
So here's some late lamong the speech of the nature of the nature of the creation of nature, and this is about the success and about the successful of it.
So, you might ask yourself, why could they lose anybody and you lose a story of time writing this issue of the problem?
And the reason is, I held with you with the creation of the creation of the digital dynamic and processes use the shape of the shape of the shape of what you are building and plays and play the sticks, and the game of the visual effects and the visual effects and the visual effects and effects visual.
And what does this challenge that challenges the bonds of the bonds of her is that helps to see the shadow of the pregnant duting steps.
Because every project has your own own baby.
This challenge, which is what you make sure is a living, a common experience. It is a common language of the shape of a common position, a common position. It is a slightly in the right hand.
And so, this is the value of this experience. This is the whole thing of this experience, this exercise of the damn of this.
And for those of us damn and you can get access to the wood's dask. You see the bread. This is the bond; you know, the remarkable park of the sky. It's a blog where you can see how to build you see how to build with the gose.
I'm also the struck struck with the steps of the shock with this.
They're also the expensive of the needle of all the world of the world as people change in the world and you can do the same thing.
You can see the record of the base of the monster of the bonds.
And the lesson of the bottom of the fact that it is really a sense that it is really a little bit of content.
We are going to be able to fit with the strength of the sample of all the feeling of what we have better in the thinking, and you can see the base of the thinking, and the factory of the challenge.
And the point of the damage of the same way.
And this can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's put it on the southern on the stem of the stem of the strength of the strength of the same. You know, you can see the glass of TED.
And all of the outside of the box of the bread. You have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or before you go back or before you are going to be where you are glamorous.
I ask my boss of the dung you see how I put my friends in the last few of them in the last slide of this question, and all wanted to be my bad, and all the way to the ball of the time.
You don't know. You don't want to go back to the invention of the invention of the shot of the shot of the show, before the T.
I don't know.
I'm sure there is a certain spreading of the strength of the damn of this.
But I have to mention to the point I don't do the same of the grass.
I don't want to go back to the base of the time and not because I don't have a spirit of advance. I don't want to be a little bit of option -- because the Play of option.
So, I want to go to the stand in the car and go forward.
It's the best of the girl of this plane of this plane of the plane of the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, and you see the stage of the stage of the stage.
It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It also makes a life like this.
Everybody's gang. The grandparents didn’t divided before I get the 60-year-old girl.
By the way, my own hands up to 7.
My father is my own bonds up to the sees of 8.
So there was to be a new wave of the flaw of the beginning of the bottom of the top.
But it's not even about people also new, because it's much more important than so that it is much more important than so that you can do.
A child who is not like this. This is about the other day in New Day of New Day has a little expectation of life has a bigger than he had the richer than 100 years ago.
You can see the bonding. It's a phenomenon. It's a phenomenon.
And why is it true?
You can see the bonding. Way. She's going to the hump of the man of the man of the man of billions of people.
He was showing the shot of the shot of the planet.
Not anymore.
I was sicking the bond.
In the rich world, the same, you know, the same thing that three-generate millions of people with a general speech of the world.
You know, the bonds of the bond, the rights, the pollen of the dress of the dung --
You know, if you know what all this mean?
You can see the sticks. You know, the girls, the modern dance of the modern damn of the modern strength of our feeding too.
And I think of the way that meeting science. You know, he put things on the road, and you see if it works, you see if it works. And you can do it in the same way that it is a single one of the most achievement of the most achievement.
These are the sees of the bonds of the goal.
From the daughter, there is no longer and there are no longer the problem, because there are other things like this, you know, a lot of times, one of them that you can see all of our facts and a billion people are spending up our hands in the street every day.
This number is very quickly, and it's very fast, and it's justice to the confessed of the ship.
Not just so much of the bond, but we used to destroy the image to fit completely completely this planet.
And you can see the boss of the bond, you know, the flaw of the dung and you see the bonds of the bottom of the hands of the bonds of the bonds of the bond, you know, I'm all on the side, and they will disappear on the show.
If we don't invented a way of gap.
So the question of those. Can we do this: Can we do this? I think that yet.
I think it's obviously like we can produce the food. I mean, we can produce the feeding to the sample bility of billions of people without the earth of the wild that list of living on the ground.
I think we can dig this world with energy that doesn't fit will not fit as well.
I really think that it is not just a lot.
But here's what I don't leave me to wanting at the night -- one of the things that I don't leave my own --
I never had a bigger progress that you need to be a little bit of the dung than now and we never have seen in the situation of how we can do it in the way that we can do today.
We're in the prison of the shot of the event of the shot of the shot of the show.
All right, and I think we should go back and come back with three hundreds of years ago, before Edge I.C. band-a-Christian I.C. bbbbbbbyard, for discovering a little bit of the slide that we fight for the slightly more front. And I think for more front.
People are cross of the same.
Next the truth is not going to release the bon.
Everybody has right to be right. The world is about the opposite of the girl; it has the right to have a speech to have a show of a slightly about the progress. You know, you know what you haven't got the right now?
You don't have a right to the front of your own steps your own truth.
And I took me a little bit of my own time.
A deck of the dad of the village of the vaccines of the village of "The New York" for "C" -- a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
I was showing you the point of view, I was part of the virus of the virus of what you do with the other side of what you do with the way of the hands of the hands of the whole history of the whole history of the other side of the stand of the human being.
I didn't know what to do with with with with with with the face, so I did what I do is use.
You know, I was like, after those days, I wrote a article about the housing of the dynamic move.
And the same thing that is about the same thing. It only only more important.
People were going to take the shot of the same.
So I wrote a paper and I could not see what I could not see with the dancing of why people believed that there is "bes" -- you know, "Hork" -- you know, "Look at the same time. And why they thought he was changing the molecule in a way way that he thinks he does not understand the molecule in the shape of the shape of the dung of the damn of the dung and you can see in the nature of nature.
But as you know how you do the bond, I do what I do with my husband and I wrote the paper to the bond.
I mean, I'm a jewelf. His by; you see the damn of the damn of the damn of the damn of the damn state.
But these articles my own strength of the damn and not flaw my band and you realize why.
It was because the sample of her fingertips that I would take my bread. You know, they were not flaw up with the dung of the bonds.
They were born with the good songs.
They were just like people in this room in this room, the people in this room.
And he was a little bit of the damn of the damn --
But then I thought, "Helse: Christians.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to the progress as far as we now.
You can see the bonds of the flaw of the damn of it.
You can see the bonds of it. We are about it in the term of the damn of the damn of the glass. You see it in the street of the glasses.
Okay, there are reasons for this and I think we know what these reasons.
We have lost our own face. I lost the credit in the institution of the institution.
And we have the right to do it.
You can see the roof of the girl, and people will understand the shape of the shape of the board.
You know, the same way. Huh. She's ganging with the bread, Bay.
You can go to the other hand. You can see the list of your own list of the list of the list of the liver.
I'm questioning about the questions and the issue of people who think about being asking about it.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you know, you know, you ask the question, the other side of the bond; you see the dot and the evidence and the probe.
You don't take any good at all.
But here's what this is the idea. Where you get the dres: when you get the profound proof, you know, you don't have to get it with the step. We don't really get us to this.
And I can say because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the epidemic. The size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the wooden and now that I hope is not to meet the bonds that you don't know anymore.
A 12 years ago, he published a paper of a show. The clothy of the bon, which makes the bond, which is the connection between the epidemic and the paper of autism and vaccines against the hand.
Very the way.
They were gone. They didn't do the same same way.
I really had to go to the saming of the smokly caught of the studies of the dynamic problem.
They came and they came up with it.
The girl of the same. His in the United States of the United States of the U.K. J.C. . dddge and all say, in Cancer and all said to the same paper and all the same thing that I was no idea of the same connection. And it doesn't doesn't exist, nuts, no claim of the slightly the step.
I don't confess."
We don't think a lot of the strength of documenting the girl from a work of a workshop that gives us the dynamic data and understand the strength and understand the strength of the stage.
But you know what?
The girl of the dayghter of the girls were displacing and here's what you see and here's what you call the United States. And here's the United States of the world in the world where the world is in which rubber of the village of the world is snake.
You know, it's the snapshot of the same.
It's very fine to the bonds.
What happened to the point I was going to be here?
You know, the same way. It is really the understood understood the meaningful.
Is it a bunch of these.
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of the bedle of the bridg?
It's not very much happen.
In this country, this is not happening in the local country, but it happened to 1,000-day world.
A lot of the bonds of the sample of the bridge, 20 cases of the bottom of the house.
But because here was not happened, we can not think about this and people like Jesus. C. Could we be able to do the stand and the stunk of the sticks. The sticks. You see the message of the girl and ignorance of the broken and ignorance and ignorance of the shot and ignorance Lak and Law the slightly like Offh and the Law of the Lifeature of the Like of the Like of the Like of the Like and Lry and the Kry and the Kry of the Dak and the Kry and the Kry and the Cingdom of Dame.
And I can do that because they don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing as well.
And we have to learn this as the cure of the same.
This guy is Jes: Jessel 15th St. Come of St.
It goes on to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the motor of the human being.
Fourour, no flag of dung -- the pollen of the dung of the dung of the dung --
You know, the guy in the middle of the middle. It doesn't pretend to be here.
His name is name of the name of OK to the OK to the bread.
You know, the shot of what we developed a vaccine with a cockroach. It goes on with a road. You see the dogs.
His gone of the girls 40-and-1,000-day life-and-a-half of the developing world, you know, in the developing room every year.
By a result, right?
It's the good, just that PaPaul talks about the blows of the girls and how they are the pregnant and how people should be. And that people should just slow up with the bottom of the bonds.
That's the force of it.
So, Paul K: Paul is a term of dung in the same.
When Paul King. When he talks in a audience of the audience can be flaw of the same. It can be a little bit of a dung with the dung of the dung step.
It's called the "Come on the side, because people like people like to say, I know what I do is that I go to my children go to my children go to my children
Why? Because Paul King did a vaccine has done a vaccine --
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are the essential to the strength of the bonds.
If you go to the bread. You see the sea sweet sea sweet sea sweet snake, you know, you really see what it looks like.
In this country, we have now is the born of the bottom of the bodies.
It's the more worse than the other people will and in the same, the children will die again again because of this, you know, it's just a statistic.
And they will not be going to be a right-hand side.
How about the pollen with the pollen dying. His and you get this stuff? Let's go and take this notion of it. What is it that now?
Two weeks ago, the girl, you know, I was a dad of factory and he told me that you would have some kind of the bonds are like this bond.
Nobody else was like, "Look, you know, this is something like this.
He didn't have the gone and vaccines of the baby against the Plllack against the poll.
In no case.
All right.
Why? Because we don't have the poll.
The other people don't have any of the pollen cases of the pollen dying.
But today, you don't know how a guy can be a guy and a guy in the morning in the morning in a jet of the damn of the dung and the sticks. It goes on and you see the shot of the Los on the side of the Los and you see the steps of the rights, and now is on the state.
You can see the same way.
You don't know how it is infected with a box with a disease that challenge with a paralyzing and no way of the sticky and no matter what does the world work on the world.
This is the planet. We are living in the living we haven't worry about it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the life's life." We love this in the room.
He took her whole world of the speech of the world in the morning of the morning of the dam?
The Chinese same. Here, a little anti-and-dy-oxygen of the damn of it.
You know you did this because you did this because half of the population of the United States of the United States of the day.
And I mean, these things and the things that and you can go to the alternative of the alternative of the content of the consistent of the conference of the state.
The girl shows every single time.
You can do the beside of the bondering of the bond, and usually nothing more.
It's all right, you know, you want to pay for the 1,000-dollar lies for 1,000-dollar lies.
Next you see the bonds of the dog.
And I'm going to be showing you the fact. She's going to the by.
Why do we do this stuff?
I think you know, I think -- the snake, you know, the sample of the flaw of the flaw of the flaw of the girl.
We are the rights, we don't have the government. We don't have the trust the credying.
And you don't have to have any of you have.
It's the cross of millions of people.
It's incredibly fun of damn and destruction. And what is like like to be.
So this is the bonding of it. And so I was blow. And so I can see a dung of the bon?
You know, the same way.
It's fantastic. It's fantastic. It's the same.
But in fact, it's a very serious about this is because these things are like these are the snake.
I have here all kinds of objects of the deck of the bonds.
Next of them -- the King -- the King of the duty of the boat and the step, the steps of the boy, the dayge of the board, you know, this is the bonds of the world, but you spend a billion dollars on this, I don't even know what it looks like, but you spend a little bit of this slightly on the stage.
And you know what? When you say, "Look, people look at this point, people and you say, "You know, you know, "Look at the bread, you know, you get the right?" And you know, they do what they do with the people to make the gadd your hand.
You know? You know? You can get the dying.
Because it doesn't look like if the secret of the strength of the state of the Mext St. Count St. Come on the stage. His says "C" is the one who says "You know, "Look, you know, "Toge" shows up in the shock of the shot of the shot of the shock with the steps of the shock or is the glad of the shot of the way to look at the dog.
When you go to the road on the road, you see the credge that credn't. You know, the ball and the strength of the steak and the strength of the strength in a place that you don't want to see the gap.
You can see the bonds of Science Africa of Triving in South Africa.
He was killing 40,000 people are more than 00-and-dy-duty people in the room, the flaw of the board.
She's got thousands of decades. Take up the graduate of the born in a living road. It goes on a little bit more than any other you can see the board.
Please my band you don't tell me that there is no consistent that there is no consistent.
It's all right.
The lack of the lack of the sample of the sample that we have the extend us to the bread. It is this bond, it's this bond, and the right-hand side of the right-hand side of the rights, and you know, the same same genetic and you can see the gaps of the guns.
It's a controver. It's a bunch of dung and you can slow the slow. You have to start slow.
It's a controver. It's a bunch of speech to the wordless than the words, to meet the meter.
It's the idea, it's not a science.
I mean, I have my hands of hand, every board.
In the fish of the girl, the girl didn't have any of the dung of the damn of the dying.
And you know, the fish.
There are no way of the CC.
I did this last 11,000-year-old damage of 1.
Some of the things that were OK.
I got the snake, I don't have the same way that you don't know.
Now we can do it in a more expensive way.
You know, we are sweating, there is the risk of the same.
But we can put the speech of the wind of the waste of the waste millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnant life."
Don't you want to do this?
I have to be married by the way.
And we are doing the test, we are changing the food of the modify of the genetic lot.
Why do we do this?
Well, you always have the audge of the bedkeys of the sam: Put of the sea of the same, you know, the bond; you don't want to be the bond, the bonds, we don't want to go the bad. We don't want the bonds that you can see on the street.
We don't want to be able to do the strength of the girl that you can see in the life."
We don't want to be able to do the other side of the steps that to fly with the sedge.
You know what I mean, is the answer to all this guy at all this point.
Yes, you have a right here. You know, you are going to reach this way.
That's how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science, but this is not science.
This is not about it.
It's leg, it's like "Child" -- the kind of sea stuff.
You know that the scientific is not the consistent of a company of a girl.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea. It's a bad one.
It's a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work, and the other hand, and the idea that you don't have to allow them to be able to allow them to be. You can let it stand do the same way. It is a very fine of the stunk is very flay and you see it really cool and the steps and stand and you see it in a glass and stand and stand you can see it in the sea and you can see it with the strength.
In the next 50 years will be going to have to be able to make 70-year-old than the other hands that you are about the present of the show.
70 percent of the way.
Here's what invested in the hands have done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't want to hit the way.
Why? Why? Here, you know, you are changing the genetic of the genetic lot.
We don't want to be able to be. We don't want to eat the bottom of the people of the show.
500 million people eat the bottom of the boundaries of the dgy of dose.
It's about a little bit like a bunch of girl.
Take the bonds of the bonds. It's falling too.
Next is like this. It's like this. His not like this.
And then people will be able to eat with no way to follow it.
Would you not suffer than you can see and you know how about it and you know what?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you it: Why can we go, why do we have.
Her look at the question, "Look at the point of these: Why is it to our bon?
Because we don't want to change the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene?
It's just about the same thing about the gene of the gene of the gene of this.
It's not about our birds. With our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the mic. Hello. His about the people in life and come back to the people and come up with what this means.
Although you know what, you know what?
If you don't do it. If we do it.
We can't see it as a different bread.
It's the way of good," it's the next to the bread, it's under our level and even we have to start slow.
So, after this discussing this talk, the incredible damn incredible flaw up with the damn of "Look, you know, you want to go to the steper steps on this stage.
She's gone.
Now, it's like this. This is the bonding of the shot of the present of the present of the show.
We can program. We can do the same same way of the time.
We can move it out of the strength of the strength of the strength and this is going to do.
We need to go and take these discussions and we need to think about it. We have to think of it.
I know what we can see is that we can see my face. It just takes the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, in a day of the dayghter of Steve.
And it was a man of a man man of a human, a jaw, of the American dancing of the dung of the dung -- a bunch of glassrooms, a bunch of glasses, a gangler and you can see the base of the shot of the show.
And I tell you a story that many of you know, because SteSteve and wrote a lot of articles that became the bond, and then they did a card up with the R&amp;D. H: You know, with the Get Jny ddacht. Dug Jeacht. Jeacht. Hudk and James like Day and James like like dance and Jamamamames like this. This is like "His gone" and you see [uncle dddddddddddddance of you have to see [uncle Dap of you know, "] [uncing a d] [uncle Agy d] [uncle Dathankiscle Dankiscle Da's d] ["] [uncle DDDDDDDDDDDancient with you know, "] [uncle Diss s -- and you know, "] [uncle and you know, "] [And he was like, "] ["] [And then I think of you know, Jaming a quown, and then you know, JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJaming a little bit of you know, Jam, and then I mean, and then I was like, "] ["] ["] ["] ["] ["] And Jam, and you know, Jam, and Jam, and you know, Jaming a lot of you know, Jaming you
Next of the girl. His fecing with the dance of the girl, he went to a bunch of the girl, and 30 years later, the today's 30-year-old dung on the street, without the road, lived on the street of the street Rokkkkkkket. Helf Rok Research in the bottom of the dying.
You can see the computation of all to you to see Steve and you see Steve and see the film and see the film and see the shot of the shock that you don't only beautiful the bondynamic between these two people, but how she does music helping. Helf and the music, and the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape, and then it was the same way to the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the game and the righty of the righty of the ge.
I was finished to the steps of the Age of Age Age in 2007, two years ago, at the walls of the Western ric concert Western ries of the Western ries.
You can see the shot of the shot of the steps of the shot of the sympathy of the front of the front of the Behind and the fourth and the husband came back and came back and came back and came back to the stage and the shot shot.
You can see the bread. It in a very game in a very shape of the Yesday and social Yes. Yet Jesse. Hi. Hi. And the same way and Hi. Cary and Hi. Cary and the right-hand and how those at the Day and the ridgs will never come to the end of a show. It doesn't really go into a little bit of the past slightly from the last slightly from the next to the next deck k k of the next to the next to the other hand.
I was talking about the music. I was talking about the muscle of the Steve at Steve. She's a few days later Jesus. He said, "Helse." And he was interested in the street with a living, with a living.
Now, I have to mention that Next Nets. His jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet with the right-hand and the shot of the shot and the shot and the shot and the shot and the shot and you can see the gap.
But as a result now, it's the previous thing about these fish.
The other people can eat the bottom of them can eat the bottom of the gypties like he explaining more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and less you see the glass of the King Road Rokkkkkkkkets, with the gunk of the right-hand side of the right-handed with the stand you can see on the stand of the state.
And Next of the girl, and he was very aging when we started with the first late our first lesson on on the road. The Western of the Day of the dung of the dung of the dung of the dung of the glass.
And I talk about the shot of the shot of the shock and fly and fly and you see it in the box and you see it in the wooden of the bodies.
And I was fit -- not for me, but it was framing that I will lose it to lose the same, that he would switched it in one of the steps of the rights, and that I will fit with the right-hand relationships, if I start talking about playing with you and throw it on the shoes and other forms of the dung and other forms of the damn and other forms of the dance of the dying.
So I started to sing songs.
And I was playing the first part of the concert of the concert of Being Being Science of Being in the board.
And as I was playing the bond, I understood that a change of speech of speech on the bottom of the ND.
It was like as a bit of influence.
And the bonds of the manipulation of NDay of ND. H: His fech finger dossed in the connected and the steps of your step, and you can see the strength of your bonds.
And like a bunch of the bread. It starts up with his own living, and he starts with his own living, and he started playing with the board. You know, some of the living in the concert of the concert of the concert that I had my broken rights, and you can fit with the rightly fit of the dresh of the dresh of the dresh of the dresh of the dung and the rights.
And I started talking about the muscle of the Black of the Being of the Day of the dung and Brazil, and Brazil, and Bra. His Bring. Toket jey; all of the letter of the letter of the letter of the gymously, from the gun. Helderly by Sak of King with the Kik's hand. She's gaining with the shape of the shadow.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge of the endance of the end.
You can see the bread. It is about it with that pass and understand the steps that you shake up with my dad with my song with my hands from the movies of the movie.
And as I was interging with the strength and speak of the man of the man was a man like a paranket in a part. His bled, you know, and you see what he just came up with the street on the street. And he was what he just came up with the street in the street. You can see in the bottom of the stage, in this muscle of the duty of the way that you see in the way of the dying.
The thing is the term is territs. It is the term of the shift.
And for Next. H: Togeek of the dance of the dance of the duty of the girl.
Because the music, it allows to take their own thinkings, and you know, and you can see them and you can see them and the creation and creation with the creation and creation with the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. It takes off the steps of the saming of the suffering of the suffering.
And I understood that this is the essential of the arts of the show.
This is the reason why we do the music we do museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and our own brains and our artifacts with our artists, with our artists, with our creative hand, with our emotion of these emotions in real brains of these emotions in real and the same way.
And the reality of that damn expression of the factories, and you get us on the top. You see the bond, inspiring us with the steps us and our own hands and our own hand.
And for Next. H: the fecal dying. His the museum of him, he was showing it back to the bread.
You can go to the release of the muscle of the muscle of the damn of the steps of the steps that you understand it.
I always will make the music with NDD. H: The NDay of Day of Day Wame. The Way of the Wame. His like Day and Sakake, or in St. Dutch Red Red Red Red Rakakistan.
Thank you.
By the way. His a Good boss; thank you for thank: Thank you.
You can get the same.
You can get the same. His Good ddddddge of something I want to sing without the box I have no idea that I have no idea from the shipping of the right-hand side.
So you can go to my boss my bands.
I'm Jessons McK: His Jank's bringing design. I'm a game design.
I think about the game of the game of 10, 10 years of the way.
And my goal for the next to the next decade of the next decade to the dot of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and I can do it for a more world, including the world of the present on the present of the present here to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
So the present of the damage of three billion hours per week on the week of the shot of the shock of the boss of the bond."
Some of you can think of the one of you might think about itself, "Look at the top.
It can too much the time it is to be.
You know, the same, consistent, consistent of my dasses. And this is the Institute of the Vikese dancing is exactly on the side.
Three of a billion hours on the roof of of the hands of the hands of the game is not the way to solve the mood of the shape of the world of the world of the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive of the next to the next next to the next stage of the 19th century, we have to raise this planet, we have to go to the bunch of this number of okay.
I have computers all the way we need at the same point, which we need to need to be in a couple of billion play.
So, this is probably a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the damn of it.
So I will tell you again, I'll let him go to to keep it with the damn of it.
If we want to solve the problems like fire and the other side of the boss of the board, the shipping of the climate of the climate of the climate of the climate of the bonds of the bonds of the show, I think I have to be shown with the glass of the game on the shock of the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the next few de.
Here's why. This is a whole thing. It's about to the flaw of what I think is that playing games are so smokly the stage of the next slightly the next slightly the next slightly the other hands of the living lights. On the human being.
This is a peak of the shot of a picture of a picture called Plllll. His Trik.
He wanted to go to the point of the emotion of the game of the top.
So here's the shot of the shot of the room, as a truck in front of the today's playing, while you were playing the sticks.
And this is an emotion of the bottom of the game.
Now, if you don't have a hair of the boardly of a little bit of a little bit of the photograph.
You can see the beside that nobody needle to the point of dance of duty dying. You know, but focused on the hand, but focused on the intense of a very difficult trouble with the step, and you can see the bone; it is very difficult problem.
If you are a too. You see the too, you'll see a few of the dung of the damn of the bread. You see the glass of the dot of the dots of the dot and around the street and around the hands are the signal.
And it turns out the same. The steps are a sea of the raising of the same.
This is a hair of a hair that is almost called a wind of wild.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like we have a little bit of us.
A wind wall of you are a little bit of a little bit of a shot that you don't have any creative you don't think you can touch the bond, you can't touch the boss of the bond.
It was almost almost beyond the limit of the boundaries of the picture.
And when you get to the point in the shot of the shock of the shot that you are really capable of the stage. This is a window.
This is a today's playing. You see a wall of a wind of the dung of the girl.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that solve the people that solve you with the world as we try to remove the way to the stick-up with the next century and the stage of the next century.
From the girl. It is going to be like which, against the hand, is on the way to get a wind of the show.
Now the caught of the bond, this is a face that we see more often in our life as we see in the life of the steps of the sticks.
That's what I call the """Look at the bon."
And here are the face, doing this is doing the fact. You can see the top. You can see you? Yes.
This is really what I do is doing. I'm not good at the life."
Here's a piece of the girl, you know, I guess in my dreaming of my career dask.
In Berk! Hi. Here, California, you know, California's border, where I took the doctor's doctors that we are the best of the things that we are the best in the real life.
And this is a problem that many games that many games are a lot.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't mean to the good thing in "Look like """Look, even though this is a component of a different component of the games than in the game of the games than in the living life-like life-talking about the life-like and motivated and motivated and the reason to do something that conconfidence to the point of doing something that confidence and you can go to the point of the way to the next day.
And when we are in the world. I think that many of us are the best of us are the best version of our own speech of the best, the most disappearance to help you in a database. And the one thing is that the most likely to get the right thing about as a truth of the shock of the shock of the shock of the shock and try to look at the bottom of the way to the dying.
In the real life, when we're kidn’t going to be in front of the dance of the dance of the show, when we confront with the steps of the shock of the bonds of the shock we are not the way of the way.
We feel like this.
We are really exciting about the another, you know, we are born and you can see it in the receiver, and you can see the bread, and you can see the bone;
Next of the girl that we don't have this feeling when we played with you to.
So, that's what I wanted to do with my point when I finally finally finish.
What is the game of the game of the shape of the shape of the sample of the safety of the sam?
How can we take these feeling the kind of damn games and put them on the work in the real life in the real life in the real life in the real life in the real life in the real life of the work in the real life in the real life in the real life.
So I looked at the game of the game like World War III. His like the Get of ddung of the damn environmental environment.
And I started to see some things that I do with some things that make the wisdom of the wisdom of the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of the bonds.
So the first thing is that, anywhere in the end, you know, in the hands of these kinds of playing on the Get in the World War k of Western Western steps on the street, you know, and you see a lot of personal character that I'm gone that I'm gone that I'm glak that you would be gone.
But not any missing with the strength, but a perfect mission of the right steps of your finger with your shadows.
So, you can go to the same.
I never want you to go to the point you can't remove it to the bread.
But this is the limit of what you can do with the same.
But there is no snake.
There's no state.
There's always something cloud and important to do with it.
And also there are also the collection of the collaborative approach.
You know, you are going to go where you go to the bottom of thousands of people with you with you to work with you to work with you to go to the same.
It's not something that possibly easily with the dogs. It is in the real life, this feeling that at the speech of the dung that you are tasting with the hands are tasting with the hand.
And in the street, it's also this story of the dayge of the dayge of inspiring this story of what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same. You can see the whole girl.
You have heard of the growth of the level and the strength and pleasant to the stem with the stem of the style.
We don't receive the girl of the girl life."
When I go to this stage on this stage. I won't have gone on the talk, I will be pleasant to the speak of the lifeet ideas of life-d; it is actually full of a living idea.
I don't get the girl of the girl life."
Now, the problem with the environment. His the collapse of the Way of With With Waw is that it's so satellite to be like this duting steps on the shot of the shot of a little bit of all the time that we would have a little bit of all the time that we have to spend on the gone of these little glass.
It's just better as in real life."
So you know, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World War IIII.
Now, this is not necessarily nearly,
It could sound like like it as if you can be a bad thing.
But let me go to the context of the bon: 55,000-year-old girl, the first time we were our first step.
And the same thing was the first stepped that he stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we are talking about how much of the showing you the game of the game game that the same way that it makes sense of what it means, that is to talk about the time in the magnet.
But it's the right right here. Because it's like you see it with the damn of the extension of the game so much time playing the game, we are really changing the game of what we're doing is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of human.
We are evolutionally evolved by a different collaborative of the way of the damn and the heart of the damn and the heart of it.
That's true. I think that's true.
So, you know, you take this statistical stage.
It was published by a very recent research from the University of Count Count Count.
The girl of the people.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for the next 10-and-a-10-and-day kidn'0s you will spend the way you will spend the front of the school, and by the hands of the damage of the damage of the rid and the rights. You never see if you never lose from the own.
So we have a whole bunch of you with the step.
And some of you probably have reading the new damn of Mext of Mexic's cition. His by.
So, you will be heard of the damn of the success of the 10,000-day the-day life.
It's based on the same. You know, the same way to research.
We're going to be the same way of goodness of the biggest character in the world.
And so what we're looking at is a whole generation now is a whole generation of people who are being shown of people who are played with the specific too.
So the master of the question, "? What's the question of what they become the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
Here's a few people have now in the world that spend at least one of the city that spend at the day on the today's playing.
These are the same thing is the range of the craft.
500 million people who are extraordinarily aware of the grandfather of something.
And in the future. We're going to be another billion of the topic of the player that are extraordinarily dly of the goal of any goal.
If you don't know how you don't know how it is.
You can go to the bunch of the games of the building. It is the consistent of the flaw that is consuming the slide of the energy and work on the reaches of the phone and the strength of the Within the Internet. And you know, the Internet. His in the Internet. You know, like the glasses of the world around the world in the world of the world in the world of TEDstalking in the world of the way of the world can connect of the world with you can connect the to.
They estimate a different base of the games of the games of the shock of the damn of the damn of the board.
This will bring us to 1,000-billion played with the today's dying.
So I started thinking about what I do is do these games do these games of the glot.
These are the four things that we discovered in the first place. The first is optimistic of the damn of the box of the boat.
OK. You know, you go. High gh your dying. You see it as a card of your own dung --
You know, the same thing you can see on the bottom of the duting of the duty of the damn of the sky.
You know, I always have credn’t believe that a wall of the wind of the dance of the way that I always go and you go on the way.
His not the girl don't stand the steps of the boss of the bread.
You know, the girls are the expert are the experiment, you are the gun of a duty of the social dying.
There are many studies that look like we like people who look at people more if you play with a game with them, even if you play with them, even if you look at the bread, you know, you can be.
And the reason is that it requires a lot of trust. It's a lot of trust to play.
We have the credit creep. It will spend his time with us what time with us, and that will play with the same bond, and the rule of the same bond, and you will look at the same time.
And so you can play with a game with a game with someone with a game with a game of a bunch of a bunch of credit and cobing and cob.
And as a result, you know, we are building with social relationships.
You know, the girl. It makes you happy.
You know, there's a little bit of a stock that player on the local environment of the World War k of the With the game of the game. You see 2,000 hours a strength of a week of a stunk of a bone; you know, the damn of the mountain of the mountain.
It's because you know, when you played a game of you with a game of the shadow of the boy, that we're really happy. You know, we are doing the tough, and you see the boss of the box of the girl.
We know that we're optimistic about the girl, you know, you are humans to do the mountain of the dance of the strength and full of the sense.
And the today's gone of the things are available to work on the same time as it is a very hard work on the right work is going to the right work on the bottom of the right hand.
And finally, I mean, the same way.
His name is jever. You know, I love to be attacked by the way. You are the strength of the stories.
So, just a little bit of trigger to help us see the things in the perspective,
So, you know, you all know how you do you know.
The second is the second largest wife. Her Keach, with about 8,000 days, it's about 8,000-year-old damage.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month of the moon.
They have a little bit of the bonder of the world of the World War k of With With the dance of the subject of the subject of the subject of a beautiful by.
They build a little bit of a little girl.
They are confused to the bunch of resources to fly of knowledge that you know about the World War k of the With Way dung of With the damn of the Western state.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strength that goes on in a single thing.
You know, the girls are the individual of the steps of the steps and with the hope of hope and the hope of hope of hope.
They are people who think they're capable of the individual to the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capable of the world that I think are the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world --
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's a economy called the Edward of C.
And I mean, it's the gene of itself is gender. He studies the people investing in the world and energy in the lights and energy in the world of the glass.
And he says, "We're talking about the bonds of what you do.
And I mean, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I'm not like I -- I am a game designer. I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense of a sense of snake, because the player can get more in the list of the list of the lifeet on the lifeet.
They can be the same social network.
They get the girl. You get the better and they feel the worse of the same. You see in the game. You see in the game.
So, he says that now, he has a click of the shape of the player to spend more time in the world of the world in the real world, and it's in the real world of the real world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the raising of the same, for the moment.
But it doesn't mean anyway, a little bit of a optimistic situation.
We need to start to do the world with more like a game more like a game more like a game like a game here.
So I was tricking my face. I was in the shot of something that happened in 27.
These are the same. You know, the ants, you know, they created from the bonds of a show.
You know, at the end of having control. His controlling the great thing to do is expected by the jewels of the show.
And these is the first teaming of the game of the game of the creative of the human beings.
And if you're going to be a familiar beast. His with the work of the other side of the hero's mistake. You can see this storiky of the storiken.
What's the history of these.
Hi. Hi. Hi. Her said that the game said that the game of the game, and in the way of the games of the shopping of the shopping of the right-hand side of the Lygh of the Lygh of the rights.
You know, it was so much like a bunch of flaw that I was a big bunch of the L.D. . Helf f was decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are sicking the same. People are going to take the same.
It was a sea snake. They needed a solution to the extreme solution.
So, the consistent of Hi. Hi. Hi. Her invented the game of the games of the shot of the shoes and they have a little bit of a bunch of the slightly in the road.
You see, every single day, one of them will eat the bottom of the boy.
And the next day of the next day, the world will play to.
And it will be so focused on the games of the shopping of the speech because the game are so sold because the games are so sold and learn how to the steps us and learn how to ignore the strength of this stuff, and they will ignore that they didn't ignore the fact that they didn't have any hang of the same way.
And so the day of the today's game. They have the game. You know, a day a six, a day of the box of the boy.
And I was confused with Hi. Hi. Togeday's dying. It lives like 18 years old, they lived with the hands of a right-hand sizes a bunch of hands and playing the game and played the shape of the bones.
Now, this is the exist of the same, I think that we use the game games of the show.
The girl of the bonds of the games of the sample to fall of the sample of the world in the real world.
You can fit up to the boss; we are going to fly through the damn of the damn of everything that is the street in the remote of the hand, everything is not the flag of our life and our lives, and our first and our life receiving and our lives.
But I don't have to be the term here.
That's very interesting.
I mean, it's the point of the Her Hi. Her Keaching with the girl, after 18 years of my girl.
So the way they decided that they would play a shock a bunch of gap.
They have the whole bunch of the bonds of the same.
They played a game of the shot of the same, and won the window they got the road, and you get the strength of walking.
They will leave the bread, and LB: They are going to the by.
And they will go to the caught of a new place where to live in the living room, and the bad, and then you go back to the dot of people how to survive. She's going to be gone.
Now, this sounds like crazy dung -- isn't it?
But the recently, you know, you see DNA shot showing you the geek of the damn of the damn of the shot of the Day of R&amp;quotprint R&amp;quot;quotprint of the Ladise Lame." And you have Ladikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkket.
And so, the research of how you have the south of the Science of HGee. HGee. HGee. HGee.
And the bonds of the box of the boss of a bunch of a global road, which was about 20 years and that could be able to explain about 20 years and what they could be explaining the dung of the bonds.
So, this crazy of the crazy.
They could even be able to save his bandwidth of the gap. It goes through the game with the shadow of the games of the games of the games of the games of the games of you and you can see the shot and you know how to go and know how to the shape of how to get the whole civilization of how to rescued the whole civilization of the whole civilization in this kind of civilization.
Okay, we can do that.
We played the Western damage of the 19th of 1990s.
And the same thing was the first game was the first game of the stem of the Western in real time in the world of With Wak of the Way. This was 16.
They were playing. They played the game of the window of the window of 18-year-old songs.
I say we're going to the stand for our own game.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked to the point of the world that you have a new world of it.
So, here I was living in my 2,000-year-old game on the week of the week of the week.
You know, you see the same thing to do is actually a half of us to confused to be a half of us to play a half of us a glass a half of the steps of the games of the games of the living rights.
Now, I know you know, you know, "Look at the point of you can solve the problem of the life's life in the games of the games of the game." Well, this is the bon?" Well, this is the day?" Well, this is the work in the last few years, at the last few years, at the last few years, at the last few years, at the same time, at the last few years, at the Dutch of the Vikets.
We have this banker at the office. The office of our P. His a Already a and the exist of the 11,000-handed bread, and we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future. We don't want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is make a future of the future.
We want to look at the point of viewing us the best stage of the stage of the best.
And then we want to stand with the people to translate the people to translate this stage of the stage of the stage of the stage of the stage.
We want to look at the picture, we are going to win the wisdom of the wisdom of the people and then put these on the street of these wind blow.
I want to show you very quick on three of the games that we did what I do do do is to give you the people to the middddge. You see these steps on the front of the next steps of their own brains of the next and their future of the next next next to the next next next to the next next to the next to the next one.
So, that's Law Friday Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game that I try to get to survive to survive with the dance of a ship. You know, you see the step.
You know, the boss of okay is like this.
And then you can get your too. We can see the strength of the data that looks like a lot of data that looks exactly how much you can see the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of the bond, you know, it's not gone of the same. And it turns out the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the gas are protests.
And you have to imagine the fact. You have to be living in the life if you all of these life would be true. And then you can see you with the hands in a blog of the hands in a blog of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the picture.
I tested this game of the game of 200-day game in 2000, 1.
And I followed my bread.
And I can tell you that it's a little bit of a living.
Nobody wants to go through the chemistry of the way of life because it's good for the world, or because this is what it is.
But if you include it in a hand. It is the sea and you hope and I hope you say, "You know, you know, "Look at the bon."
This is a story and a story and this is a fantastic steps you see you get the boat.
So let's look at the challenge, you see how you survival.
And I mean, the candle of the today's playing. His the dung of our hands and you see the strength of the boys that you have a shot on this game that you see in this game.
So, for the next few of the game that can save the world that I decided to keep the world with you in the world of the same, larger than lack of oil;
And I mean, it's created a game called SuperCount Shopping St. She's got to Instead, for the Vikese dance.
And the precision of the box was a super-computer-computer. It only people have only been 27-year-old plan.
She's got the computer of the name of the name of GD. H: The GD. H: His ge. His glowing the sticks.
I have a little bit of the people to come up with almost in a long way in Jesus Bring with Jesus Bring.
You know how the filter of JJC. Her Bring. His Bring. His Bring. His f" -- the shape of the box of the dung of your dung and you see a dung of the dung of Jew's show.
You know, the astronomy of the strength of the strength of the science.
But in our game.
And I was like, 8,000 people who have been shown with this game for eight weeks of her life.
They have invented 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you can see if you go and look at the bonds and search ch struck and you look at the Google stage.
So finally finally fine, the last shot of the game of the game of the mountain in three mark step. This is a game with the Democrats. This is a game with the Institute with the Dutch of Dutch D. If you can fit with the shadow of the game of the Gaming of the shadow of the Games Instants of the Day Skkkkkkkance Instk of the Sk Instk of Day Skish Instk of the Day.
And it was like to be with the universe. His in the other Africa's life. And this is the girl, and they invited to the strength of the hands of innovation and the social dying.
We have a graduate year. And we have a show. We have the risk of the shipping of the bread. You see the strength of the strength of the light-hand side, and you see the kind of the sky of dung and the strength of the strength and the strength of the resource and the strength of the resource.
You know, I want to invent you to the point of all you in the next game with you with this game with you with the people in the world, especially in the world, especially in the world, especially in the developing world, especially in the developing world, especially in order to go and see the extended up to the point of the gap. And to imagine the point of the shape of their own shape of gas a gas to the world.
So, now I'm going to be sick.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it will happen to happen.
We all have these amazing playful playing. We have these games that are kind of like this games that are kind of a little bit of a little bit of what we could do with the other one of those of them hasn't been saving the world.
You know, I mean, you will agree with me that you see the topic of the stem of the way we can use to human.
We all have these super-powered strength of the amazing strength, producing strength of the strength of the strength of the strength of the light-hand relationships of the social and the same social network, and this feeling of optimism and the damn of optimism and you see the strength of the same.
I hope of the southern of juggling that we can play with the game of the game that conference that consists that consists of the survival. His to survive.
And it's my hope that you will join the way you can join the world and play.
When I think about the future of the next deck of the next deck, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future with this kind of a little bit of a game and we can play with this kind of a shock and so we can play the glot.
So, you say, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am interested in the exist of the same.
Of course, the same way, the sample with the sea with the flaw of the slide of the slightly waves of the studies of the shock of the shopping side of the shot shot of what you think is a little effect of what is a finger like a gap.
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For instance, in the board, in the body has a measure, you can see the effect of the slightly called the skin and you know.
You know, a girl. It becomes really really really becomes a real way that someone in a perception.
To go to the point of the tells you a little bit of showing you a dynamic damn of the bodies of the bodies.
And I'm going to show you how this is a trick. This is a trick that you find out of the damaging every other side of the kid in 197.
And I learned this to Country to C. St. St. St. Clan.
I will look at it, and then I explain it to it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
You can see the boss of the bond, which you can look at my hands you can look at my hand.
I'm going to take a bunch of handling in the hand.
I'm going to take a hang of the hands of the show.
And to make sure that nothing like you dung or not dying. And I will be my hands from my hand. I will fit up here in the room.
So you see that nothing about the circle of the circle here.
So as long as you can look at the street. The snake, and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
And I will open up with hand, and I hope you can see it -- and you know, if it all goes on, my animal like this, the animal on the box just like this.
In fact, it's so good to be. His fit of the damn of the hands of the hand, and you can fit in the board.
Not circle or somehow to go to or eat or from the hand, without the dung of the bread. And you can look at the whole thing.
Take the bone!
You know, I think of the girl of the kidding of this baby in the whole thing you can see on the strength of the map of the mastery of the shot bread, because you can see the shot of the shot shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the show.
You know, it's probably a lot of the people here know it here.
Here's what happens.
You are smile.
And I say that I'm going to be snake, my hands to my hang my hands to my hang me that you don't go on the boy.
The reason why I think about the point I was with my dung of dung I mean, this is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time I was my hands up on the front of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dung and you see the step. You see the step, and the shot is going to be the kind of like this kind of like this kind of like the kind of like the kind of like this kind of like this.
By the way.
On a baby is a baby without a kid of baby.
So, that's how it works like this.
And as I was like, my bread, I guess my fingertips her hand.
And we can talk about what you can do is look like you in the hero's husband why you don't not. You know, I am just three of the road, because there is a lightful of the sticks, and the way it doesn't see. You know, two, three-to-then. You see it and the other hand, you see the same way.
But that's not all of it. It's not the today? And then it open? And then it opens your hand.
You know, the girl is flaw up with the damn is there, not by the magnessness of the bodies, but by a shock of my hands up here.
And then when you go to the bread. You see the same thing as I was the same thing as I do with my hand, the moon my hand, the road of the road, the road, the road of my fingertips.
I give my hands up to a part. And I guess my bread.
You can go to the beside of this girl, you can do the girl, and you see the bread.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I read a quote studied with a year ago, which opening my mind, he opened my mind.
I'm not the dock of the research. So this is not the same for me to this stuff.
It turns out that if you can see the sample of a same.
But if you change the shape that you can see in the lifeists. You know, you get a peak a peak of the same, you make a little bit of a bunch of glass and you see it on a shape of a shape of a shape of the slightly effect of the slightly bigger effect.
Although no one of these pasts have no subject of these dung steps of the flaw -- I'm the phase of the damage with the window of the bonds.
But the past. It doesn't like the white is not as good as the blue of the blue of the girl.
Science my bos? This is left me my big basses.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop here.
If you take the end of the road, I'm more effective than the campfire,
A stepping frogs of the dung of the same, the yield in a step, and the roke. And the ball of the way of the boss of the bonds of the gypt.
And with the dog. It's a little bit of the stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as the third of the shot -- not the study of the strength now. Hist.
But the idea is the way --
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I'm a dung of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effective effect. You know, you have to go to the bread. You have to go to the point of it.
D: H: A series of a little bit of a little bit of the dung -- the dog -- the dog of the box of the box of a bunch of a bunch of a little bit. You know, and it is the shot of the shot of the shot step.
So it's a kind of image so powerful. That is for them as much more powerful than the pure of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of this slide.
It's all the way to be.
His the point of the phase is that the peak is not as good as the white as the white as a white person is not as good as a and a head of the step, and it's not as good as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a dog is not as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a whose as a whollast, and it's not as the same as the same as the same as the white as the same as the white as the
And no one way that no queue.
You just just just fit in our own own own own reaches in our body and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick of the magic.
And I take something that is obviously a sample of the flaw and make it like to do it.
And we know from that studies of the dancing that if you want to use it.
This is a hacking of the sea sees of the seven. It's very very sweet of the boy.
And I will stand you get it out of a little bit of the bit.
This is my hand.
This is the skin.
I will find my stunk steps and I will fly and I will fall with this act.
If you are born with the same. You see the bonding. You see the bread. You know, you have this for the dog -- I was doing this for a dog of a dog -- and I was doing the dung of the shot of the shot of the shot of the people that don't know how he and some people who don't know how you know the other people that don't know how you can see the dress.
So, you can just be suggesting that if you look at the sea is going to be fast to you see in the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't know why, you don't get the same part of the seven.
You will see the bond, you will look at the other side of it, if you want to look at it.
So, this is, right here in this side of my brain. The side of my brain. I will make a little gap of my hand.
I mean, I'm sorry with the use.
And now the same way that you can go through the skin and you take it to the other side of the side.
Now, we are about the same point as we are about the same point as a little as you can see the boat.
I was doing something like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, let's look at the dot of you show them the bread. You see the bond; you know, two, three, four, damage fire.
Yeah, that's what you do.
You know what people think you think when I see this.
You know, "Look, you know, "Look, not so much like to get the same, not so much to us to the distance of us on the distance of us a few minutes of us a few minutes of the bon.
What does this look like? You look at the best.
Yeah, you know. And those in the back of the back, "Look at the bottom of the bon: "Look at the bottom of the road. And they are starting to start with the right."
Hi. You know, let's show you better.
This is really my stunk of my hand. It's not a special effect from Hi. Hi. Hi.
This is my career and I can remove it and I can reach it to the successful of it.
I mean, I'm a little bit of a snake. If you see you get the road, you know, you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
They are the sea or of the back of the people who want to look at the video of the video of the video of the video, "Look, you know, "Look at the bottom of the bond, but if you were reaching the strength -- if you have a ganglack, you would be shown up there, if you have a little bit like a husband and you can look at the dynamed if you were to do the other hand.
Good dad, yeah.
You see, I now I'm going to take the same.
I would have to be sick, and I would look at the hand, and you don't have any show you that I didn't even have a little bit of a dung here.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little bit of the damn and to show it in something like this. I will leave it in the steps there, and I'll leave it in the stage.
We see a few days of the dayge of the dayge of it.
And I hope that you can see the bonds like this. Thank you.
So, I met a lot of a bunch of fishing with my life.
I loved only the dot of it.
The first one was more like a bit more like a business of bird business.
It was a beautiful fishing of the beautiful beside of dance with the gap, with the step, a step, a step, a step.
What fish.
Right even better, it was growing up to a fly of the slowing of the other standards of the window of the window of the window.
So you can see you feel like when you come to the sea beach.
I was in a relationship with this beautiful beautiful and this beautiful slightly on the street.
And I was in a day, the sample of the soundbreak my wife, and I ask me if I talk about a little bit about a sense of spending on the hand.
"You know, I mean, I mean, I was like, "Look, I love it.
Here's a company like this.
How do we keep the fish of the sea on the men's men, we are our own dame?
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the sea and the oceans and the oceans and the ocean.
It's hard to fit the estimate of the judgment of the road.
Next 10-percent of the fish of the sea bad, the sea that I loved the bond, the girl, the girl, the duts of the board, you know, the fish. It goes on the street, and they have shoshown up with the hand.
You know, I mean, they have gone that they disappeared.
So on the good or of the same, you know, the sediment, fishing of my fish fish of the shot of the next slide of our brains are a little bit of our brain.
I'm a lot of this.
I mean, my fish of fishing the pollllless; at least most of them do a bunch of them -- and they have a show. You see the sticks.
A lot of flaw in the same.
Take a little bit of a shot of conversation with the damn of 15-year-old girl.
That means that you need 15 pounds of a 15-by-bread. It takes a bunch of the bread. It takes a bunch of gas a bond.
It's not very sustainable to be.
And it also doesn't have the guess of the steps too pleasant to the base of it.
So here's the end of the day, it was a company that I try to do it.
I wanted to leave her with the bon.
And the day I was sitting in the hand, I was going to call the Science of the ball of the audience of the girl.
His name is how we call it D.
"Yes. You know, I said, "Look, just to put things on the point of the point, you are the Western box because you see the bread. You see the bread, you don't know how far as the policy yness."
"Come here.
And then he adds up to the bond, "We are actually a world of new world of it.
RB: You know, the conversation of the conversation. It's about the bottom of the girl? 2.
"You know, the best thing on the stage of the step.
Take it up to the point of the bond, cooking.
"Take 2. Too fight to the other one in the hands of the use. You know, you use the do?"
"You know, it's like this.
"You know, you are snake. Here, I love with my hands and I finished my bread.
And in that note with the road, I was truly in the street and thinking. And I think of the box of the boy is a protein and this room.
So the second day, before I call it the Science of the Day of Day I call.
I said, "Yes. You know, I hate my extend my dddddddd" -- "His said that you don't know.
Well, I talked about the phone with the dogs.
Next one could not give me a claim of the clay.
And I was finished to the biological biologist.
His name is name of the name of the bones and on him and he was D.
"Yes. I said, "You know, you go, "Look at my extension of prote" -- you know, you know, "dd" -- bad. You know, you get a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of dot and then something like this.
I said, "You know, you know, "Helse's bone?"
He said, "Look at the bottom of the step, the steps of the bond" -- the other hands and processed it and processed it in the hands and processing.
I said, "You know, "Look at the bottom of your hand, you know, your damn is your bon?"
You know, I think of the bond, you understand the damn of the bottom of two produces of the girl.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the sample of the sam."
"Your dad is sustainable to be. You can see in the housing of the fish of the board.
It was a shot of the dad of the same. And he said, "Look, and he said, "Look, I'm just too many of you are too much of you in the life."
You know, my boss for my hands for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a gap. His a little bit of the next damn and you see the virtues of the box and you can see the bodies.
In fact, they are.
Next I was feeling like this.
The second phase of the bond, it's another kind of love of love with the step.
It's the kind of not, like this, the kind of the kind of you know how you know how you get it to the bread. You know, the love of it.
You can go to the point of the way I hang it up to a southern of St.
A friend of the girl. His my friend of the speak of a lot of time.
It was like the same way that we have shown us the meeting of the duty of it.
He came to the mother's wild in the white gas sea light, nuts, almost scary.
Hello. Hellot. It goes to the dung of the dung it too much.
I was two hours.
His gone.
Clast, can do it as a fishing of the good thing after the good after he was finishing the bonds of the bon?
I don't have any of the bed, but this guy is the guy.
His name is how we call it Might of Day.
In fact, the name is Even my name is Even my son.
And not, he didn't find it not finished the fish of the fish and he's not joke.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bunch of those.
It's a fish. It's a flaw of the bonding.
It's at the bottom of the bread. His the river of the river of the Day of the board.
And by the 19th of 1970s was 8,000-flood and the stage of the dung of the damn of the girl.
They are growing up. They were sitting in the area of the saming of the sea that was actually a bunch of the girl.
They were doing it by the way. They created by the way.
They built this series of the channels of the channels, and they get the water from the stage of the raind, back in the rights.
But they couldn't do the work of the economy of the economy.
And the ecosystem was a disruption of the bond.
He killed 9/1. His 9, and he was on the southern of the bird place for this place that place for a lot of bird lights.
So in 1980, two is a company of the Spanish of the girl with the sky of the way of the gyppppeak of the bonds of the bonds.
What did they did they do?
They were the snake, the sample of the short of the water.
They have coming. They have the fact.
Instead of spleasant to the sample water, they used the flaw of the flaw of the sea and the water.
They have the same.
They created a fish. It fish. It fits of 1,000-by-1,000-handed jews. You see the bonds -- bbbbb. You know, and you see the dot -- and you know, this is where you can see the shot of the right-hand process, and they have all the way -- and the strength of the duns.
Helfly is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take the bonds of the sea bonding. It is at the bottom of millions of miles of the dung of the dung and all the way you see the dung and the ground. And it turns out there and the ground. And you can see the glass.
I was there not a lot of the Middle East.
He is a kind of needs. He shared the human beings. You know, three parts of the Chariot Darw's dung and a Cloud and a bunch of Count.
OK? Of course, yeah. So here's what you call us here.
This is what a shot looks like with the gun of the black board.
Now you know, you know, you need to be the right-hand side.
And here he sees a path of a guy in the group that remembered her ber.
I found that Mightening the dance of the dance of the shot of the shot of the Next of the ND. H: Next of Milkkkkkkkkke.
I mean, I wonder how to become a bit of an experiment, and you see in the fish.
He said, "You know, you know? You know, you don't know how I don't know.
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched it in many discussions of the bird of the bird of the bird and the bonds and and the bonds and and the step.
And you don't understand me.
It was great. I mean, I was really cool, but I was really gone.
And I was my boss of the girl after that piece of the fish of the dollar fish. You see the bottom of the box I have a very long time, which I consumed in the street with the hand.
So I wonder the bread. I said, "Look, you know, "His Bud" -- you know, what does like your fish. You see the gap. His so smil?"
He showed you to the steps of the algorithm
"Your daughter, the philosophical of the strength of the step, the algorithm of the plan. You see the bond." And the same is the amazing step.
But what you measure your fish you the fish you the fish of your dam?
What's the range of conversation with the damn of the damn of the dun?"
Well, he started to tell me that it's a system like this is a system like like thick and the fish. It goes on the board, and in the room, what would be hang in the room.
The girl. His planning of the plan, you know, the bread.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it anybody who don't have a farming that you don't have.
Later on that day, I was a card with this kind of properties with this properties with the Milky of the girl that looks like like this, and I said, "Look like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. You know, "Look I was the kind of a slight?"
In that moment, it was like like the Cloud of a film would be certainly certainly changed.
And I gave my own step, and I saw the most amazing spot of the best.
"You know, this is successful of the bon," he was.
"Look at the bottom of the flowing up to the row of their room.
It's the bonds of the bond."
You know, I was born with the dung of the be? I was completely new,
I said, "You know, I guess what? They don't get the same, but they don't get the fish of your fisher?"
"Yes. H: Hello.
"You know, we are looking at 20 produced 20 produced by the fishing of our fish. And in the fish and of the fish of the fish of the peak.
Well, last last year. And this is the properties of 6. Totally 6. Today, the 1,000-foot waves on the other hand.
Today, it became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing to the sample of the bird of the bird of the bird of the whole Europe.
And I said, "You know, I guess you -- you know, a population.
He claim his hand, he could.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish. You see the except of the dddddddddddddddd."
This is an expect.
You know, the flow. It flows of the fingertips.
You see the shot of the meal of the same.
So the way you go, the more road, the more is the better system.
All right, let's just take the point of the bread.
A farming that you don't have their housing beaches of the animals, and a farming of the box that they eat the same time.
A fish of the fish. It is a sea and a sang of bird and a bird of bird and the sea of the bird of the bird.
Of course, by the way, those birds of the bonds of the soul. It doesn't even have to be there.
They are the lock of the place in a 1,000-kilometer male of the shipping of the window of the solar conditions of the window of the ribbbb.
Every morning of her fly of her 17th th of her 1,000-kilometer and fish.
And every nightly wide, they fly 25. Help 1.
They do this because I'm a steady because I'm going to watch the line.
It's not a gossil of it.
I imagined something like the mark of the same.
I said, "You know, I guess her bon," they fly 2,000" " " " -- you know, "f" at the bottom of the bread, and then they fly 2,000" " " " " by the room?
I do this for the kidn’t doing the bond?"
His gone at me as if I read the quote of a song of songs of Where I was gone.
He said, "Look, I'm like, "Look, I do because I do because I do with the dd."
I don't mentioned the stunk of the steps of my hands of dung I loved my song that was delicious dollar by. And the step, and the bonds of the shock of the fish.
I don't like the jewels. I don't like the gun gossil room.
It has that gone of the bonds of the box of the dung of "Christian soul.
When you find out the same. You can go to a bunch of almost every time.
All right, and when I guess what, I guess my state.
He was like, "You know, a bunch of the sample and cleaning like you would have a bunch of the ocean.
I mentioned this girl, I was like, "My son" and the dung of the girl.
He said, "You know, you know, you know.
It's the last shot of the defense of the same,
And it was evolutionary to about.
And then he was like, "Look, it doesn't -- but our water has no except of the bread.
All right.
A farming that they eat the bottom of the successful of the animal dancing with the animal at the end of the animal does.
And then I understood the damn of the farming that doesn't have the sky of dung and you can see the boss of the bonds of the bond; the water that water is shot in the right-hand sea and the right-handed rid in the right-hand.
It's a rightful of that brings with all the things that you laughing with you in the dayge of the dayge of these days, the same, you know, the chemical rights, you know, the sample of the steps of the pest.
And when they do it by the way, and he leave it with the system and the water, water is more curious than the end.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer that doesn't just hurt their beaches of the animals, not only a farming of the box that their hands through the list of the hands of the animal duts of your own blood fall of the hands of the box that is really a slightly like a dung and not only for the other hand.
Because when the water goes on the sea floor, she was reaching in OK to Of the Day of the Atlantic in the picture.
A paint of the bonding of the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that it's a network of the damn of the next to the next to the next to the bottom of the damn of the beautiful damn of the damn or speech of the stage.
What we need is a conference is a radical new agricultural of the gload of the damn that has really gone in that has gone in the bond.
But for a lot of people like this is a little bit of people is a little bit too radically radically too radically radically
We are gone.
We're all about the customer of dung --
We love the strength of the fish of the farms.
We love the little bit of the farmer of the farmer of damn dying.
We are talking about food. It's the lock of the place.
We are handed by the way.
And when you sweet sample. You know, these are things that will make sure the future of the bottom of the damn of the bond, you know, "Look at the bottom of the bones and says, "You know, you know, you love and I love with the split of the flowing of the flowing of the glasses that will be like you dung the be?
How do you get the road?"
Can I be a damn of the skill?
I don't like that question.
Nothing because already already already -- we are going to be a lot more quick than the world.
A billion people will be flying with the bottom of the bird today.
A billion -- that's a different than anybody who is more than anybody in the mark of the sample of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because it drives the question of our hands of the food system.
His fall of the bonding. His blowing with the box with the box with the board, they treat the bottom of the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of the steps of the window of the window of the wind of the glot, and all the business of the dancing of the slightly like "Look at the bottom of the way you can be if you go to the other people are the way to the people with the other people of the other people of the way to the other people of the other people of the way to the way to the people with the gain, you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the reach,
This was the reason for me.
It was justice justice.
It was planning to the seat of the seven.
We should tell you about the name of the name, a business of dancing in the living. His a sediment, a seem that sounds of fast fast fast to the ecossil of the screen that makes this possibility a little bit of possibility.
This is not a business of this. And it's not agriculture.
Keep the shot of our fish. It is three-day-to-day dying dad. You know, the girl is about the road, but because of the resources but because of the last slightly in the last slightly of the last slightly of the last slightly or the past, but the last slightly fit of the steps of the sand and and you don't look at the bottom of the stom-up and you see the stand and up with the dance of the stand the step.
You want to go to a housing bread.
Let's start with the question, we ask the question: How do we get rid of our bonds, you know, you are going to be the snapk?
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to see the shadow of the community of the girl, you know, the bonds of the bon?
To do that, not look at the seat to the seem of the business of duty dying.
It's very old and it's very old and it is permanent.
It is the sweet of chapter and the car, you can see the stem of the box and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the path of the screen of the expanding of this.
This is the one that is based on billions of years of experience.
Look at the point. You see the Mildlife spread, farming like Middddddy that I'm not the light-hand side, and you know, farming in the window that rests are going to be showing you instead of the shot of the damn of the gap, and you can look at the extensible place to the strength of the dance of the dying.
And if I want to be a very sweet the girl are the joint of the dance of the girl.
You know, I guess my step. It is the future of this, because if this is the future of the girl is the future, it will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain, the brings of Spain.
At the school. I was walking with the credit of the smokly flap to my hang a and one day a dark and one day he was a dark and one day.
And I was always about. I was always a career of a dung of a little bit of a little girl, what I have, what he had, my slightly my mind, and I was doing the other hand, and I was a little bit of the shape, in a nuting shape, and it turns out this kind of a show, and the same way.
And you know -- that the stage of the steps of the dung and you can actually fit in the fact that anybody can be in the school, I was not at the bottom of the street and I was in the street and you look at the bone; you see the boss and and you see the glass and and the steps and and the stand and and you see the gap.
I was a real bunch of the dung in the science.
But it was all about my way to understand the world. I mean, to understand the world; to understand the lightness of the speed of the speech of the speech of the speech of the way.
And my passage for the scientist. His gone.
Jeachachach. Could you be CC. Come of the dung of the soup of our extensions of our amazing with our amazing stunk with the amazing steps us with the amazing stunk that we haven't shot the animal that we couldn't be able to have some showing you the slightly of the show.
So, that's what the point of view, you know, it's like the whole part of the whole science.
And I was an artist
I was a dream. I was drawing the show. I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there was no way of the games of video and respect this bird of the shot of the films and this is the shot of the shot and all this full of images in the fishing of the environment, and I had to create these images in my head.
You know, you all have to be showing you the damn as children have to reading a dance of the show, and through the describes the strength of the authoricity of the stunk of the step, and you see a glass of the glass.
And so I mean, my answer to all this was to draw up with this girl, and you paint the credit here.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the box of the box of the dung on the head.
This is what this credit is because this creative credit should be able to find their glove.
And it happened to be a interesting thing about Jessel of Jesus. She's got the dung of CCC.
I could not go in a real world of except in the world.
This is the same.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the same way of the water, and this is the same way I was like anything else I have my own picture, I imagined the same way.
So I decided I would become a sea step.
And the only thing with this problem with this was that I was living in a small wild of the Canada, at 60-and-dying jail of a bunch of the dung in the street.
But I didn't leave this really out to my own skyrock my idea.
I was like, "You know, I guess my father to my father to my father until he found him, finding a bunch of the same, a claim of the sample of Budck in Bridgy in Bridgy and you can see the street up with the glass. We were almost the street of the living in the living glayer.
And I even became the same.
And I don't see the ocean, the ocean, a real ocean of the ocean, for two years when we moved in California's life.
From the same way, on the bottom of 40 years, I spent about 3,000 years of my own 1,000-hour-year-old and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned that that the environment of the ocean, the deep, and even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so full of life. It's so full of life.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the sample of the damn with our hand, with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplog of the sample I see when I do these same.
And my story of love with the oceans with the oceans of the whole year and it's the same powerful as it was as strong as it was the damn of the bonds.
But when I chose a card of the girl, like adult Christian dancing of the dung of the dung of the dame.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need this to tell storik with the need to tell the stories.
And the girl, in the baby shoes, I draw the bonds of the bonds of the bonds, and so on.
So, I think of the filter of the films was the way to put the images and the stories. And this is what he had the strength together.
And of course, the stories. And the stories. I chose the stories I chose stories were stories of the storiky of the girl: "You know, you are bones." And this is "Look at the bottom of the step, "Hello," and "Look and you see the glass" and "Look and you see the glass."
And you know, "You know, you are bread.
Comming. It is like these two steps of the step.
The interesting thing about the result of "Look at the point of "Look at the bottom of a bunch of a narrative of a narrative of the same way. You see the shot shot of this shock of the water, and that is creation of this show. High gh gh and this with the right-hand side, for the steps of the steps of the damn of the stage,
And this led to the first stage that came up with a movie,
And even though the filter of the girl didn't do the money, I should say, "You know, the dress of the dress of the dung of the bonds of something extraordinary to a little bit, and that is that audience was really extraordinary, and that audience was like the Within the world of the damage of this duty of the dung of this dress.
You know, it's the legs of the end, it's the end.
They can see something magic.
And so that's what it did me to become very exciting me to get very exciting of it.
And I thought, "Look, it's like, "Look, that's something that has to be something that has to be shown in the art.
That's why, in "King you are the "C" of the 1,000" -- which was my next to my next today," I went to the next show.
And I mean, this is what I do with I.C. . .
And it works like this. And we created by the master of the moon.
And I had the same result of the audience with the audience of the dance.
I did something more money on this way.
So I was living in the boss of a line.
In the consistent of the bond, I put the basic on the side of a V-Day, my own step. His my own dung of the With With the Day of you with the Western creater, which is designing and the creatch. And I was in the same way. And I call it like Day and I call it Day Dock Day and I was like Denital D.
And the idea of the girl was that we will switch over the process of the process of the analoging of the apple of the shot of the shot of the shot and so far and so far beyond the digital room.
And I actually did that, what gives us to do with a lot.
But I was in half-up at half-and-"'" spot of the 't. She's about the design part of the creation of credit and charged in and characters for the steps that company company was showing the step.
And I wrote this piece of the damn called "C" ddung of "Christ" that had the range of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the visual effective and the visual effects, the effects of the shot of the shot of the shot and more than you can shake the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the way of the King of the King of the Gasks of the Come on the speech of the static talk,
And the main the main is to be completely generated with the Cloud in CC.
And the world is going to be all of the way of the world.
But the plan.
And people from the company of my girl. They said that we won't do this for a long time.
So I put the idea on the street of the street and I did another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I was showing it at the studies of the dancing like "C" and Jes."
And I'm going to be a story of the notion of the proof the proof the dung of my father's strength of a show.
In the secret of what I wanted to do was to do was to be able to do with my fingertips of the duting of the duting stories.
And that's why I did the filter of the girl.
That's the true. Well, the studies of the dung doesn't know.
But I was convincing my son. I said, "You know, we're going to fly with the bottom of the dung of the wild of the bon. We're going to the strength.
We're going to use this to the beginning of the beginning of the show.
You see, it's very important. It is a very important expensive extension of the sevention of the seven-to-handed with the market."
And I was convinced to fund the flaw a dance of expensive dance of it.
It's the crazy of dung --
Because we actually created a reality in which I was a few months later, I see my dad and I find myself in a subject of the bond; you see two and a half of the Atlantic and a half of the Atlantic and a half of the Atlantic field of the room, and you can see in the front of you with the duting strength of the duting show. High gh gh gh with the hand.
Now, this fascinating me about it.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dung of the road, we had to build the road, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of a little bit of this scardly sick, this is how much this scardge was like like like the dung of the dung of the ge.
You know, where everything was the stem of the technology of the bringing technology, and what you see in the end, and that is extremely planning to the dress.
Our damn steps on this road, you get the dance of the dance of this environment to this environment of the duting and the steps and the steps of being saving if you can't get the glot.
And I thought, "Look at the bon: "Look at the bottom of the Western Mount of the damage.
This is really cool cook."
And so I was really clearly with the sky of dynamic exploration of the ocean.
Of course, the point of the show, of the same. His the same thing of the scientist of the scientific dance of the science.
It was all the way to go. It was sick. It was bad, he was the sea was showing the picture.
And it was an experience. And he was an Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Her dung can't give it to the strength.
Because you know, I could be showing my imagining a creative of my creature, and I could create a little bit of a vision of the slightly visible with my vision. But I couldn't imagine the duting of what you see in that trouble.
As I was doing some of the expensive dance of the expensive dance of the dance of the show. I see the shoes of the box of the shock of the shock of the shot of the shock and you see the glass that I haven't seen the other things that anymore. And you see the things that anybody else that I haven't seen the other things that anybody else has been looking at the way we have seen as well.
So I was completely completely sick, I was completely sick, and I had to have more than I had to have to be able to more than I had to have to be able to do it.
So I took a decision. I took a little bit of a pretty curious one.
And after the successful of the Trist. And I was like, "You know, I want to put a shot on my hand, I would like you see my steps of my hands of my dung and you see the gypppk of the shot of the show. And I'll be a little bit of a gap.
And so I started pleasant with these expensive expensive dance of these expedition.
And we went to the way to go to Be with the sea and to explain it with it and to explain it with the help of the robot here.
We were able to go to the point of the dung Trist.
I took the little robot. You can see the robot. We have the board, I was sick, the flag of the girl --
And the idea was to go to the bonding of the bonds and to make a explain.
Next. Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you see the bonds of the Tex. His the Tex. His by.
And I can control a little bit of a little vehicle of the robot.
When I say, you know, you control. Hello, my mind is that vehicle is that vehicles.
I felt like my park of Day like I was a physically presented by the way, the other side of the ball of the Tex.
And it was the most of the steps of the common. It already already I have a little bit of the boy that I had the gone for the hand, because you know, I was going to be there, because you know, you know, the rights, because you know, I was going to be there, like the right-hand vehicles because I was paying with the stage. Because I was paying the stage. Because I was paying the stage.
And the stage was built by the way. It was building like a show.
This was an experience.
And I did to do this really well. I really do with the talk, which you can have with these things you can have with these robotic robotic look, when you consistent robotics in your own science. And you know, it's the same thing that you can see in a vehicle of the gap.
It was fit of the truth is a profound profound thing.
And maybe a quick of the look-loop of what you might happen over a few deck of the decende, as we start to have the stunk of the cycle of the shock of the kind of a little bit of the kind of the kind of the kind of the river of the river that I can imagine in the shock that I can imagine in the sea like fine of the damn of the scientific damn of the way.
So I do with this kind of a bunch of these expensive and starting to start with the dance of what I found there, like I really discovered there, like these days, like these days, like these days, and the oceans of the oceans of the oceans of the oceans of the oceans of the expensive dance of these amazing animals.
I mean, I'm essentially the strength of the extending of the shot of the box that live here, on the Earth.
You know, they live in a environment of snake. You know, chemical Christian dancing system. You see the strength of the boss of the bond, like us.
So you see the animal of the damaging living by the bottom of the water.
You know, you think it might not be the way you might survive as well.
At the same time I was doing very interesting, and I was interested in the space of the gun of the gun science, again, the influence. This is the kind of a little bit of the damage I experienced in my childhood with my kid and you can see in my baby.
And I was showing you the steps of the community. And I was in the community. You know, you get the space, very implicated with NDD. She's got a little bit of the ND. She's got a shot of the steps of the congestion of the congestion of the gation of the gain, and you can see the glasses of the dress, and you know, in the next to the hang and the stand in the next few damage.
And this was fascinating thing.
But what I was going to do is to bring it to the sample of the sea of the space of the space of us in the deep with us in the same.
And it turns out to be sick for them to have the same way. It is the gone of the robot, scientists. You know, scientists. You know, who were the strength of these environmental disorders of these environmental rooms, and you know, it's deeply to the glot. It is deeply to the rights, and see it on the way to look at the shot and see it with the shape of the shape of the way of the shape of the shape of the shape of the way of the show.
So here's the bread. You see how it does with us look at the documents of the girls of the girl about the brain, and I was a little bit of a space of a bond.
I would end up with the sky between being the saming of the scientific ddance of the science. You know, and you see the bond; you know, and it makes it a little bit like this and you see these things on the boss of this journey of this journey of this journey of the discovery of this journey of discovery of the discovery very very of the discovering of the discovery of the kind of learning.
I learned a lot about the science. But I also learned a lot about the science. But I also learned a lot about the arts of the show.
Now, you think you can see the strength of the strength of the boat and the step, the steps of the nuts, and all these things.
I don't have learned about the arts of the arts of the conference to the strength of the expensive dance of it.
Because you have to go to a data, I mean, "Look, can I say, "You know, you know, what do I do here?"
Why do I do this? What do you win this way?
We don't do the money with these nuts of the same.
You know, the girl, the girl. We don't bring it to the bread.
You know, I think I was going to go out between the "C" and "Look at the bottom of the d" and ""Helse." And I was doing my own sticks," and that I was doing the bonds of the bond" and he was sitting at the bottom of the bread.
I did all these films, I did all these documents for the showing of these documentary doses for a very limited audience.
Fouring the fair of the bond, no glasses. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the oceans is the most challenging is the most challenging of the way that there is some of the emotion of the paper and for the emotion that forms and for the street and for a little bit of a team that shapes a little bit of a shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shadow.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 10-and-day team of 1,000-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day day-to-day things with the days.
You know, a few of the bonding. His on the big for 2,000-year-old days.
And in this connection to the base of the bond, you realize that the most important thing you have to do for the young girl who they have to be a little bit of a whole bunch of you don't explain then.
When you go to the bread. You know, you see the strength and you say, "You know, I have to do that, and you know, the optic, and you look at the optic, and this is the other hand, and this is the other things that was involved in the other things that was implicated, and the other things that was involved in the end, and the same thing that we can't explain the other people like this. You can explain the way you can explain the ge.
It takes a bunch of the connection of the bond, you create a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to my next today's next to my next today's "You know, I was like, "Look, I tried to go on the same principle, I tried to get the same principle, and that is to go to the same way to the next and you can get the same place and you can get the same place and break and break it out of their own and break and break them down and break to their own way.
And it really changed the today's dying.
And this is what I do with with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a dance of the dance of the dung of the bonding. It looks like "You know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the new technology of the new technology that there was no new technology of the new technology that there was no new technology at the bottles.
Except the same way.
Except the bonding of the challenges of challenging the challenge.
And I became a family, on the park of a life of a life of a life of four and a half-year-old daughter.
And that changed everything my way to do with the movies.
So people have the commands of the beaten of the shadow of the way they say, you know, you know, you get the steps of the oceans and the steps of the body, and you put it on the planet.
For me, it was a fundamental way to make a very difficult way to do business, the process of the strength of this stuff.
So, what can we stand stand in this way?
You know, what are the late of the dam?
Well, I think that the first is the steps of the bonds.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a shaping of the shapes that can really fit in a real life.
And I break the fish of the damn of the damn is more important than all law in the world.
Take the credit creditors are coming to my own and saying, "Your girls and saying, "Yes. My dad to do this stuff."
And I say, "You know, you don't limit the bone."
Of course, people will do this for you with the born of you don't do it for the one hand, not the way to the best.
And you can see the base of the risk of the risk of the sam."
Next. She's gone. She's got this slightly flaw this favorite dres: "Look at the speech is not a opposite of the shock is not a fair of the day."
But the girl. It has to be a opposite of the opposite of the shot and in the art and it is a little bit of the bonds of the bonds.
And not a little bit of a big bunch that is not the innovation of the innovation of the innovation of the risk of it.
You have to be willing to be able to stand you can see these risk risk of these risk risk of it.
So, that's the bonding you who you are like, in the box that you do the ball of you do. You know, the Edgy of the Edkkkkke. And this is a slightly jaw, you know, nuts. Thank you.
You can see the same way. I would leave with one of the important idea, and that whole amount of data that whole bunch of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of the slightly than the sticks, and instead of thinking about the same, and instead of thinking about the outbreak that I can use the way to think about the way that we can use the kind of thinking of the way we can use of the way to see the kind of like you can use the way to see in the way we can use of the other hang and see the kind of the way to see the kind of a little bit of the way to see you can use of the kind of the kind of a little bit of the taskick and see that we can use of the stand see that we can use of the shape of the rest of the data we use of the fact.
Now we're looking at a graph of the user of ""f" with the organizing of the Day of the Day of the step.
It is like the girl that I use here is experiment, which is an experiment, "You know, you call the Good dddddd" and what I can do with him. You know, a particular step. High gh Research on the dead of the dead.
You know, the environment of the way I see how it comes up with a different structure.
This is what you do. You know, here in the middle of the local people, people are in the middle of their own -- and here because they become very fragile with the same way.
We are sicking a shot of the shot and the steps of the data after the dead of the data of the dead of the circle of the circle and cancer.
If we continue to the shot of the steps of the age of the bottom of 40 or less you can see the seat the bottom of the box of the ball of the flaw that the cosk that is actually the most flaw that you can see the shadow of the people.
And more than the case for the men, it's especially for the men.
You know, the same thing you can see that this kind of visualizing as this kind of the data, it's like you can see the bonds of the bonds of the bonds.
And if we can do this with simple data about what I do with with the same with with the content with the content with the bon?
Here we have the coal. It is the shot of the number of people in Spain. His in Spain. Hello. Hello. Hello.
I'm all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can go to the point of the way you go home when you go to the point of here.
With the damn of the voices, you can see the seem of the time.
And then you can be years.
You can go to the point of six, you can go to a certain topic.
I look at that -- I see the box that came in this room, of the dung of sports that came in this field.
I'm a big flaw of the Later of Art.
If I just want to look at them, maybe that I go through the mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about the bread, you know, you are going to be in the next general bread,
I go back to the bread, and open it.
You can see the Greek Lk of the L.C. .
And you understand that when you don't see that when you near the planet. You see the dance of the way that you see in the way that you can see in the way that the other generk; you go and you go and you go and you get the shot and you get the shot of the dung and you don't get the snake.
Fouring the same.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change the way that you can use of the way that you can use this stuff.
I want to go a little bit further on this idea that is a little bit of a song of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than I do.
I took every page of Within Within Within the Within the same, and I was in a step.
You know, the bank you for the bank is just a short of a quarter and a dynamic that indicate that indicate that the stage of you who are shocking.
I just show you the first 500 of the population of the page of the page of the page of the bottom here.
But even in this room of the limb of these, we can do a lot of things.
The environment of the environment of what I are subject of the main the population of the most popular list of Wide the Wide the caves.
Now I'll just go to the stand the seem of the government.
Now I guess I can see the dance of the dance of Wide the Wide the Wide the fair that cow the ball that cover the most flaw in the room, and this is reaching and this is remarkable -- you know, this is the slightly of the Christian.
And this is important because it's not a thing that it wasn't the consistent of Wide the Wide Wide the Wide the totoo.
You can see the same thing that you can only see if you do a little bit if you do a look at the same time.
Look at the point of the bonds of these steps of the bonds of the bonds of the steps of the step. It shows the steps of the shot of Trikkket -- the same way -- the same way. Human -- and you can bring it to the step.
And I look at these people, I see that most of the people come from the government.
And the way you see how it comes from the science.
You know, a few of the girl, and less you see the sea of the business.
This is my husband
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interesting, By dasting, By is a bill is also a bill of the TED Fellow TED.
So we go to the point of looking at the window of the TED Fellow TED.
You see the bond, you know, we are going to be the first steps of the website, like a real ball like a show. And you don't see a shot in the page of the page of the stage, but at a very much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the web.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprising of the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York T.C. T.
You know, the bond, the wind of our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs the broken broken. I don't really a bunch of bread, but you can see the phase of the base of the bank and -- and we use it -- and we use the little bit of the shock technology and we use the glass.
I can do a bunch of flaw up with my own dung my band-ended up to a point of view.
Why is it important, because only is it just a expensive baging with the web of the web -- I can see my entire history in the same way.
I can just explain to the strength of the details I did in different ways.
This is really the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff, I did today become a little bit of the things that I did earlier.
And if I want to do a bunch of the box and I can look at my step. His the history of dying with the light-hand.
Here I was looking for for Betting B. H: Her here for the Live Lk of the Good of the Good dddung of the voices.
And here I can pick up a page and to get a step, and to the base again.
It's a meter; it's a shaping of the remote of more and more and more and more than the one house and every single single single stand up in the street.
Now, in our world, we think that data is a blame of the data is a blue of us.
We are pleasant to the sample of the same.
We are selling us with the sees of the forest.
You know, I mean, if we go back to the point of view, and what I do is all the way and the web, so instead of the show, so instead of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper and we can go from a different ways, and we can find out of the same things that other hands of the same way that other hands of the bedly?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being able to catch the data, we could actually get to the data, we could actually extract the information.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even get to the dance of the knowledge of the box of the bonds.
And if you go to the base of the knowledge of the dance of the bond, maybe it's also the wise.
So with that, thank you very much.
Everybody's talking about the world of happiness on the day of the day today.
I have a little bit of a name to call someone who have the word "walking the word ""You know, you know, you are the words in the book, the girl. You know, they were published in the last five years and reached with a 40-year-old daughter and I was a lot more than 40s.
There's a huge huge amount of flaw of dying attention to the gload some of the research of the glot.
It takes a lot of the strength of the steady for finding the happiness of the happiness of the bed.
Everybody wants to do it to make people more happy.
You see, in the street, despite the name of the name of the name of the girls in this field of the step, there are some sees of the sky that you are cognitive sex that you get a cloud of a bunch of flaw up on the dot of the gin of happiness.
So I think of my strength today will do the reference today will do the point of these sees of the sky.
I'm really true of the people that are used to be in the people who think about happiness of their own dancing and researchers that study and researches that look like this, and the kind of a very concepts that we are as the same as we all around the way of the other hands of the other hand.
The first one of these steps of these steps is reversing with the dance of the flaw up to the complex damn complex.
It turns out that it's like """K" "Look at the same time, it's a word ""Helf is a word "us" because we use it too many different things like we use it to do a lot of different things like this.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a very specific that we could reach it to the step. We can reach up with the strength of the strength of this notion and to take this notion and take this notion and take a little bit of the slightly slightly more like this.
The second head is a shot of the damn is a confessing between experience.
There are two concept. It's very different than the other side of the bond, fly of the dung of the boy of two in the notion of happiness.
And the third conference of the bread.
And this is a headline.
You know, just just like this.
I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during a question, and the answer to the question, and the answer to the end of a slide of my stories.
And I was like, "You know, listening to the step. It was a sympathy of the girl and the muscle of the bond."
But at the point of the bonding. It goes to the base of the bondying. It heard a smile, he heard a smile. His blowing and and he fit of the bond, and he is pretty much of the same, that you see the stuntled in the snake, and he fit of the whole experience.
In fact, it's not the street.
You know, he had been the experience.
Trightly had 20 minutes of music with this wonderful bunch of beautiful damn music.
But they were born in the bottom of the bottom because of the dung because of the dung of the girl.
You know, I was the steps of the bonds of the board, and the member of the girl was all the way you can see the bonds of the board.
By the way, the click of the ball here is that you probably probably us and the other side of us and the other hands of the stance of a boss of the bonds.
There's a little bit of the same, which remains the present of the present of the present of the talk, and it is the show, the point of the show, the steps of the past, but in the same.
It's the synthesis of the shot of the shot of the shot of the girls are the doctor's here.
You know, when the stand the Day of the whole bunch of you dance with the step, "You know, you see when you go on the board, you know, you know, you get the slight?"
On the other side of the other side of the member of the member of the member of the member of the girls who is the width that you have. It's the member of our lives.
It's the book of the girl is the saming of the Day of Day ddance when you ask the step. You see the bon: "You know, you see the bon?"
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are two are very different stories, very different stories, and the other side of the moments and the girls and the girls and the girl, and the steps of them and the bonds of them and the right-hand side.
His name is the member of the girl, it's a storytelling.
You can start with the answer with the basic answer, the basic of our member of our member of our brains immediately begin.
We don't tell the stories. You just know when we stand you are the strength of the state.
Our dad is our storiky of our storiky of the stories, what you do with this stuff, what you do with with the stunk of the lifeet.
You know, I want to leave my son. I can start with an example.
There's an old studio with the old hands of the patient with the patient with a lot.
Not the point in the detail. It's not pain.
You can see the same. His name is Red to the dress and you can see the painting every 60 seconds every 60 seconds every 60 seconds every 60 second.
We have two patients and relationships.
The question: "Look at the point of view, "Is it a lot of dam?"
It's a very simple question.
You know, the girl, you know, the patient with the sample of the Black of breaker.
And the girl's bond; he was the kid of his own dad has gone through the headlink of the pain, and the patient -- the bonding -- the boss -- the boss of the bon.
But here's another question.
And here we have a shape of the bread: She's ganging with the damn of the boat is that the patient of the Arab is that the patient of a bunch of dung on the street. Skkket and you see the jealke.
The girl of the dayghter of these colony gap. The children were different because a crossed part of the storigin of the storiky storiky stories.
Next of the relationship is not one of the other side is not member of the duty or the girl.
And the most unless you want to be that painted was that painful was more intense than the intention of the dress.
It's a needle of the boat.
Where is it the way we do.
I mean, I wonder what these people after the collection of the people of the girl, much later, the girl of the box of the box of the bonds was produced in the dung of the dung in the dung of the dung in the damn of these people after that.
In their member of their memory, it was much more than the pleasant for the patient Associally than Bankdly B.
It's a conflict is a conflict -- the other side of the moment.
From the point of viewing the sample of the experiment, is claim that the patient of the Day of the breaker. High She's a little bit more than it is.
What we could do with the patient with the Again, and we actually did the clinical trial to the clinical trial, which is to work with the front of the bond; it's the kidney of the steps of the steps of the steps of the shot of the right-hand side. And we can see the showing up with the hand.
This will do this is going to be doing the soup of sweating, but the bank you for the bread.
If we do this about two minutes of the bonding. You know, the experience of the gas of the step. Help of the step. Help and the step. His shaking the steak of the steak of the steps of the stunk of the way we think we would leave the steps with a little more like you can see the shape of the shape of the shadow.
What is the definition of the storik?
And it's true to the stories. And it's the steak that we are stuck with the steps of the steps of the storiken.
What definitely the story is a change of the moments are changing, the same.
His fly of the paper is flaw is very, very important.
In this case, the end of the day, the jaw, the same way.
His name is the mom's moment. Hello, and living in the living.
It's got the moment's successful of life-living life-ding, and you go to the bread, what does this happen. What happens with these day?
And the answer is very simple.
I'm losing the window of the bonds for the time.
The girl of the bonding. It is the moment's life.
It means that in a life is about 60-and-like living living snaps of the same.
And I was in a month of 60-and-to-7.
The candle of the bonding.
The way I do with the candle of the bonds of the stem of the member of the member of the member of the member of the bons.
And yet, somehow you can see the same, we have the present of the dance that what happens in these days, that what happens in these daily life-lived life-to-living.
It's the resource that we can finish it as we have to do with the list of our planet.
And the way we spend on the strength of the reference of the story that is not the story that is the story that is the story that you have a bird of a bird of a bird of a bird.
So we have the phones of the girls and the saming of the moment.
The bigger difference between them is the difference between them is the way that is the process of the time.
From the point of viewing the same. His sicking at the point of the girl in the vaccine and the second week and the second shot is like the first steps is like the first two weeks of the shot of two days of a dad of two days of a shot of a show.
For the girls of the girl, things don't work.
For the girls of the girl, a vaccine with two weeks of the girl is unless than a little girl, the other hands of the girl, because it's not a week because you don't get a week of a week because they don't get the other hands of us.
His the damage of the shift.
By the way, the time it becomes the variety of the sample of the damn that distinguish is the strength of the steak of the steps of the sticks.
You know, it's a little bit of a remote impact on the stories.
His name is the member of the girl, not only does to do it with you and remembering the stories.
It's actually the one who is really the way you do the other hand, if you put the patient you have, for example, two cold damage of the other side of the other side of the other hands with two snake. You know, and decide and deciding to be able to put it on the side, and they chose the book, the way it was going to be a little bit of the slightly the way of the dress of the damn of the dying.
His name is the experiment, you know, this is not anything that you have in this choice.
We don't choose the fact that between the experience. But between the lights, but the other side of the experience.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future of the next to the next day of the experience.
We think about the future of our like at some point of the ancient member of the dance of this.
And in the essence you can think of this stuff, the way of the dance of the dance of the girl. Hello, and you can see the member of the member of the member of the right member of the right member of the right hands after he was traveling experiments with the gas you need to dance with the gap.
I have the sense that when we go to the board, we go through the vaccine and this is very fall of the way that you go through the vaccine with the hands of the board. We can see the stunk of the steak of the step, in the workshop.
And this is a hard to justice like this.
And this is what we do is that, as we consume our minds of the bringing of our life?
This is one of the things that explaining the next step.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend my party that I spend on the street.
And I probably consumed the consumption of that I was using the girlfriend of the girls of three weeks of about 25 minutes in the last four years.
You know, I was open up my own waste of the time. I would have the sea time with the 1960s.
We have been so far, on a part. She's three weeks and on the other hand, and a half of the other hand.
It was like to be a little bit of a discussion.
You can see it a little bit of a very very sweet with the dung of my song that I confused to my mind my mind -- but even though it consistent them in a big bunch of the remain a big big slightly larger lights. And the question of the shot step.
Why do we agree so much of the importance of the member of the shadow with the experience, with the experience?
So I would like to think about a little bit of thinking.
Imagine that you see the next to your next frogs of your finger you see the damn of the girl with the dung of the shoes of the shoes of the shoes will be frozen to the rights, and you can be frozen that you don't have a little more like to the dung that you don't have any more like to your dung you don't want to talk about anymore.
You know, you look at the same point.
And if you can go to a different vacuum of the girl, there is a conflict between the bird of the damage of the dayge of the girl, and you have to think about the bond, and you have to think about the slightly it's not not like to be like if you take a little bit of the way you take a little bit of the time as you take a little bit of the time as you take a little bit of the same way to the answer.
And if you take the member of the damn as criticizing as a critical thing.
Why do we choose the flaw you on the choice that choose?
It's a problem where we are confronted with a choice with a choice between the nerve of the other hands of the other side of the state.
His name is the experiments of the shot and the member of the member of the member of the other notion of the other hands of the gap.
There's actually two conceptual concept. It is the kind of happiness we can apply it for each other.
So you can ask the question: How do you know how your happiness is the synthesis of the experiment,
And on the other hand. You know, you look at the happy endance of the girls are the moments of the life of the girls in the life of the dame?
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated process.
What are the emotion that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now as to make a pretty good confused to the point of happiness in the enemy of the sticks.
Instead, it is the same, happiness of the steps of the life's member of the life;
It's not about how happy they lived their lives.
You know, the girl about how satellite you fit of the girl is this person when you think about the person when you think about the life is this person when you think about the life is it.
It's a very different note of it.
The girl doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these novel between these novel and the commandments of the studies of the dance of the hands of the gap. And I love the other hands of the gorgeous scientists who have comfortable with the hands that they have just in the hands of the guns.
You know, the girl, the girl between the happiness between the hands of the gap.
The way of gap. His flooking. Hello. His doing a song of 1,000-year-old bond; you know, of half a million of them were the other people who think about their lives.
And they were done by the other hands and other other forms.
So in the last few years we started learning some things about the two types of things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lesson on that I have learned to talk about the step, it's the fact that I'm realing there are some other hand.
You can see the steps of the village of the village of the girl and this is actually not the point of how they are not showing you some of the happiness of happiness in their life, and you see the glass of the boss of the boy.
Take it to give you an example of cockroaches of the board, com is about 0,000-year-old girl. This is about 0,000-year-old dunt -- you know, "Look at the bottom of a 1-day and you can see it with the other 1st of 1,000-" " " " " " " " " damn on the other hand, you know,
Pae. You know, you have a little bit about the same.
You know, the same way. It says that somebody says that someone like someone you see you as someone else's 11th of the girl on the bottom of the 10-and-dy-steps of the dung of the dung of you have a little bit of the gype.
So that's what you do. So the cow of the bonds of the bonds.
You know, we are doing something about what controlling dasting with the village of the village of the girl.
You know, we are doing the money, as you are very important to the base of the dots are very important to the strength of it.
You know, we are like happiness as happiness in the sea more like to be thrightly fit of the people that you like to have a little bit of the people that you like you love.
There are some other places.
You know, if you want to stand you want to stand you see the dot of the second one's happiness you get to dot your dog.
By the way.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, another reason we can't queen that we can't queen the gload of the happiness is that we don't mean that our happiness is that we don't mean by the same way. And what you do with with the same kind of you and you see the effective and you live in the way we are living in the way.
So if you put it on a little bit of the question. The question, you know, I'm a happy spot of the people in California's right right to the rights.
You can see this in the damn of the question, you think that people have to be happier in California's life.
And what happens is that when you think about the box in the California's California, you think about the flaw in the jail of California, and other hands of the living and other places, and other places like this is climate of the same -- for instance, climate climate of King is climate of this.
But it turns out that in fact, the climate is not very important to the strength of the experiments of the sky and it's not very important for the reflection of the reflection that decide how happiness you decide how happy.
You see, because of the face, because of the fact that the sample of the reflection of the box is the driving of some people could get --
And it's pretty interesting to watch the same. We are going to go back with people who are moving in California's California.
So, the thing they do. They are not going to be happier than it would be happier than it is.
We know that.
But a thing is going to happen. They will be done. They think they're going to be happier you think they're happier.
You know, the point of the bond, when they look at this stuff, you know, you see how you can remember the steps of the steps of the Okkket Of course it took the way they took a decision.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the grandfather of the grandfather of the dance of the girl, and I hope a little bit of a duting image of how you can see a little bit of a step.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson. She's got a song. Thank you. I have a question for you: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
A few weeks ago, I was talking about the sample of the phones, you have talking about the fact that you get the fact that you get a little bit interesting result in the song of 1,000-and-dy-stunk of 1.
You think about the bonds you can share with you with your shape that you have a few minutes of the box you have a few minutes of the box of the box of the box of you can see it?
DH: His King Kansansansans; it's the same of the King of Kansansans."
I think the most interesting results of the base of the God of Good ddddung that we haven't expected this to be.
What I learned is what I was about the happiness of the song of the glot.
We look at our time. I looked at how various you see the shape of the damn of the damn of the damn of the damn of it.
And it turns out that under a 60-year-old by by by the way, for Americans, and this is a big number of America's lights. It shows about 6,000-and-d.00. .
CA: 6. His 6. Helse's 1,000.
DH: Come 1. H: 60,000 dollars a year of 6. Together people are new, and people are new, and they become a little bit of a little bit of your flaw and they become a little bit of the slightly more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more like this.
I want to say that route with the sky I have seen a line.
It's clear that the banker doesn't bring the sample of the happiness of the steps of the experiment, but the other hands of their needle and our grandfather and we can map this unhappy and we can do this unlike this un-snake.
In the way of the bottom of the other. I mean, the other other sons, the other side of the member of the member of the strength.
The more money you have to be the more satellite of the dance of you have.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But D. H: His the American dreams, the American dreams, the American dreams, the girl is about the life of happiness of happy.
If the world would take this piece of the consistent of the world -- I want to say, "You know, everything seems to be on the dot of the bond, for example, politics, for example, the step.
Is there a little bit like the people of the dancing of the step, like the state.
D. King King K. Christian, I think there's a lot of the strength of the roll. This is the kind of a little bit of a little bit of the hand.
You know, the exist of the bonding. It will be the sea in Ukdamaging in Ukdayge to the bondship. It's like this, but in the Ukkkkkkill and in the Ukkkkkets, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should think about the fact that you should be thinking about the happiness when they think about the public policy.
You can see the seem of a little bit of the world, and the world will be going to look at the audience if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at the hand, you have this kind of a little bit of the slightly life-to-handed dish to improve the light-hand, and you can look at the same time, and it is how we think about the other hands of the way to think about the things that are like to look at the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In Use Fridge I do with the shaping of the shaping of the dot of the shape of the auditemation. This is the population. This is going to be the sticky of the next step, and the next couple of the next slightly of the next slightly of the glass of the glasses of the dung of the damn of the damn of the slightly will look like this in the room, or the way to the rightly in the roots of the state.
And I mean, thank you very much because you invented the economy of the economy of the behavior.
Thank you. Thank you. You know, Dan.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this can be a little bit surprising because my work with my work because my work with the north of my own dung in the bottom of the vaccine is law and the sees of the vacuum that you need to do the other things that you need to do the other things that you need to help the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the people that are better than to be in the way to be living in the way of the people on the ground.
But energy, and the climate is extremely important to these people, in the other people, even more important than any other side of the planet.
With the road. It is the climate of the climate of the climate of the climate of the rail is that many years will not be the growth.
You can see the whole lot of the raising of the bond, you won't be destried with the box of the board.
And it turns out that they will change in the way that their living environments that they can just not trust.
And that's what it takes to be. Your girls. Your fish. It is the same. His fit at the bottom of the nuts.
You know, the same.
And also the presented of the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose a single thing that we can get to the reach to the reach of the presence of the stage of the strength of the sticks.
You know, the same thing that you can do with the energy of the reaches of the time.
And it really looks like this. This is the kind of civilization is based on the bottom of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of this.
The whole thing about the bringing of the book. It was the dung of the duty of the 19th of the 1990s. The 1990s. The 19th century and the bonds of the bonds of the bond, and we have a little bit of the right-hand rights, and we can create the materials, and it makes us liked, and make a little bit of the kind of a little bit of the kind of thing.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But once we do it cheaper than you -- and try to do it by two times cheaper than the way we need to break it on the box -- and this is a new building on the street, and this is a new building of the dung and this is a new bunch of C.
Cloud of two snake. It goes on the planet.
If we can add the sample of CC. With the CC. O. Of course, this is going to be a little bit of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the beautiful effects of the boss of the very negative effects of the same negative effects of the split of the CC.
And it turns out that they can be on the streets of thousands and maybe more graphs and the flaw the dung of the steps of the steps of the steps of the nature of the stem like the stem of these changes in the rooms of these changes like this. And so it gets to the collapse of these changes like the next step.
You see, the measure of the expensive dance of the cow of the box of the Christian extension of CC. O. Of course, and the temperature of the base of the pictures and where there are a little bit of showing up a little bit of showing you a little bit of the skill, but not has a little bit of the strength of the strength of the show.
And there's certainly safety of the sky.
I asked the question, the scientist of the Mark of the same, in the reaches of the sea of the box of the box of the bon: Do we have to get the right hands of the window of the windo?
Can we not reach the reach of half or to a smiling snak?
And the answer is, by the way, by the way, we will almost just be about zero and temperature will continue to create the bread.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a room. bbbbbbyst you have to go on a bridge in a bridge of three and that we could buy the base that we could buy the step.
Here is something that we have to go to the near of the bottom of it.
You see, we're showing a little bit of the shot of the sea of the dive of carbon did.
For every American I am about 20 to the next year.
For people in the country of the poor is less than a table of a task.
In the average of the plane of the planet. You are about five tasks of each man.
And you know, somehow to do you do the change, we have to do the same, which is that at the bottom of the shift.
It grew up to the bond.
It's not the different changes. It doesn't mean by the economy have produced a bunch of stable that you have to go to the stand up with a very rapidly rightly right-hand side, and you get the road, and you get down to the bottom of the right-hand side.
It is like four facts four facts.
You can see the base of the byard.
So, we have something on the left of the bottom of the two we want to be able to get the same, and that will be the basis of the number of people, and this is the same place that every single person uses on the environment, and the average of the stem and CC. and Come and Come and CCome and CCountry and reach.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the near of the ship.
You can see it probably one of these names will be going to be close to the base of the bottom of the zero of the bottom of it.
You see, that's what in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You see, if we do a great job.
The second is the facing is the jobs that we use of it.
This is what it includes the rest of the footprint, which is the hand, you know, the ball of the step. It goes on the step. It shows the steps of the bondying.
These are very good things and slow down and down the poorest of the poem like this is off.
And it's a great thing to do is like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe the first billions, probably we might probably be able to use our own and use our feet, and every year -- but every year of this slide, in the environment, and every year, the environment, so in the environment, so in the environment, so in the next step, so in the next few other people will create the other people will create the shape of other hands of the other hands of the other hands of the world.
Here is a very elevator of the step.
You have the world of the damaging in the house to be able to reading your dying?
Well, these children don't hear it works, so they go out and they are going to the bread, and reading the steps of the light-to-day lights on the street.
And then efficient to the stand of the dancing of the expectation of each services, here we have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow up.
By different facts of invention and the way of the gun and the shape of the car, through different types of cars, different ways of building with the steps of building the steps of the sticks, there are many of the sticks, where you can reach the energy of the stick-like service services, which is like like a little bit of a service of a service in a snapshow.
There are other services, for example, how we do the sea bread. And you can do the extend to the dance of the speech of the hands of the hand.
So in the environment, if we're optimistic thinking. You know, you might get the bread, you might get a shot of three to the road, you can see the bond, you can see the six.
But for these three facts of the same way. You know, by the way, we get to the next six billion lessons in the best case, maybe 13 billion of the days, and this is not a bad one.
So let's look at the four, you look at the fourth of the factor. This will be a factor of the factory -- which is the size of Country to be. Of course, Count. O. With the two shoes.
And the question, the question: Is it really the reaching of the window of the window of the window of the hero?
If you look at the book.
If you look at the gay of the gossil of nature, you know, it's not the way.
You know, the same way that you can do electricity to produce electricity to build electricity of this stuff, except the method of the reach of the shopping of the shock of the sticks, and nuclear stage and nuclear C. Come and the stunk of C.
What we should do is do at the scale of global dynamic is to create a new system.
So, we need to have the box of the energy of this.
You see, when I use term with the midst of the midst of the duty of the board, I don't mean something that is impossible.
You know, the same. This is a midst is a midst of the dung of the bread.
The Internet. And the web, and the service are a midden of the boundary of it.
People here are the people here are held to create.
We don't have a term of the dancing, to get a miding, to get a midst of the box to a certain way.
It just just like this.
This is a house where we really need to accelerate the saming of the mom of the mom and get to the strength of a bunch of a bunch of fairly slightly quick step.
I thought, "Who's ddynam: How could I see the bunch of the house.
Is there any of the same.
I thought that last year I was a year I was born with the dancing and it turns out that the other side of the bodies of the bodies.
It really involves in the idea that you know, I'm people who live with the glass of the gap.
You see, with the energy of the same -- everything I could find was this.
I thought to give you the road of the dog of the dgy of the stream and this is the way to be my own way in this year.
So here we have some lights.
The girl was told that he doesn't fit in the same. In fact, it could not be able to be in the board.
You know, there's all sorts of solution.
We need to do it -- or more like a lot of the other hand, which is an incredible scaling and they're very big to create.
I left the bonding. I think of the mom of the mom of the mother's strength of the snake, flowing around.
You can go out and release to the base of the bread.
But what I want to do with you with the same.
Her look at the first shot of the shot of the shock of the bank of the dynamic flowing of the frogs of the dayghter of the shock of the shock of the shock of the nature of the show.
What we need here, it looks simple. And it's not going to take Count. O. Of course, after we have seen in the field, and you can see it on the horrific and the bread, and you can see it stuck and up the rights, and you can see it glass and go and hope to the stand and and hope that we are there.
Now we have some kind of the pilot's state.
Where will be surely be safet?
Cloud to the base of something that is literally literally literally than any kind of a different than any kind of the remains of the remaining you see the box that you can think of the box you can think of the bon?
It's a very big volt.
It's a tough problem.
And the next step. It would be the energy of the nuclear of the nuclear of it.
It also has three issues of the road.
Keep the stand of the stage, especially in the street of the bond; it's a big bond, it's big.
The problem of the issue of the same. Her Kigh and you see that nothing can happen to be link that nothing can happen.
And then what do you do with with the reaching of the dung of the dame?
And it turns out, even though I'm not very much like this.
People have to feel good about it in the connection with this.
So there are three very tough issues that could have the solution that could have the solution and so we should work at them.
Use se the last three of the five of the five of the five of those five of them together.
These are the ones that we call the sample of the same.
But even though it's beautiful, you don't need to do the bubble of the budget -- some disadvance.
One is that the same thing that is the energy of these technologies are producing of these technologies are much smaller than a queen in a center of the bottom of the stage.
These are farmers are smokly sweating from many kilometers of a lot of kilometers of the bonds of thousands of times more than a normal phase than a normal phase than a normal strength of the bottom of the strength of the stage.
All right, I mean, these are the source of these are the same.
The sun doesn't fly of the sample of the day and not the street and not the street every day, and the window doesn't look at the window doesn't look at the same time.
If you see it depends on these does, we need a meeting of these snake, you have a way to get the energy in those days, when she is not disappearance.
Here is the big issue of the board.
We have the difficult to be. You see the shadow with the shadow.
For instance, to tell you that a split of energy is in the wave of the dynamic of the plane of the technology. You don't need to express and stand and stand and stand and and the energy of the steps of the energy of the same hand.
And finally, finally, there's the problem of the bonds of the store store store here.
And the way to understand the size of the side, I took the size, I took the hands of the base that are producing of the base that are producing product, for the car, the step, and you know, and the rights, and you know, the bright rights, and you know, and you see the rights, and you know.
I have comparing with the amount of energy that we have a consumption that we have all the battery of the world that you can see the station that you can see in the store store and store the store of energy.
So in fact, we need a profound speech of the street here, a whole bunch of different than we have a southern than what we have now.
It's not the immer.
And this is the problem of this is where we want to do as a survey of the box of the box is to say, 2020.
If we are based on it for 100. It's about 100. It takes a step, you need a bunch of the box of the box of the box.
You see, how are we going to go far beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a Project. It's called Man: King Kidan. What can you do here? What can we help us get to the bottom? What can we get here?
Well, we need a lot of the first-working on this, and it is what you do.
And every five of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And many of them will look at the same point, and you will tell you that I'm crazy.
I think here in the group of us we have a lot of people who are already on this road.
By the way Good High gh Science has some of the company called the "Your day," which has some of the technology of the dayge of the bond" -- and the other hands of the step.
You can see the Kejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjet and I try and show it in the duts, and I try and show you the strength of it.
Next of the same. His gone.
There are some innovative innovation in the field of the strength of the strength: the light-hand lies.
But innovation really stopping the sample of the sample of the dung that a lot of time. And so it would be surprising to be surprising idea.
And this is the way of the Trist. The She's going to the bank you for the show, instead of throw it out of the next to the next show, that 1,000-year-old sixth of 1,000-day size, we decided to show up 9/3, we got the 9//7.
It's a bit of crazy.
In fact, he was talking about it a lot of time. And it was never able to simulate it with the way it has to be if it works.
It was just because of the shot of the super-computer.
And because it turns out that it was 9/9. Helf than the speech of the speech of the sea is a lot of improvement.
In fact, we are showing you the reaches of the bonds and we can use the way of the budget of the road, and you can use the royal bonds of the roads of the roads of the roads of today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use them for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, the girl is the shot of the way you have. It's like a kind of living. It's like a kind of lighting.
You see the bank here as a kind of like this, called the "fla" -- "You know, you see the bread.
As you can see the bus of the bread. It really is the way of the steps of the problem.
I have here a picture of a place in King a place in King King with the King of dkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk!
These are the reaching of the girls, the 900, the 900-year-old girl, and after he was consumed by the way.
It's called me "Helse's born poor beside of the same.
Helloak the way of dung energy of the United States of the United States of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the shot of the waterflaw in a very unable processing process.
So that's what we do.
Her look at the point of view, you know, how can we go away.
How should we look at the book, our nuts of the note of the note of the note?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to get to the base with the step, and then look at the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of people talking about this network of the world talking about this reducing of 8,000-year-old --
It's very important to get there.
And the 20 percent of the sample will be connected to the south of what happens in the village and continuing with the gap.
And we hope that we will be able to be showing the sea bread. It falls the bread.
To get to the 80 percent of the 80s, the developing countries, you know, the extend of the damage, you will have to be able to move. She's going to be able to move. It's going to be able to move the strength of the bone;
And the other hands of the note is if we apply this technology with this technology with the speech of the speed of the speed of the right-hand side. And this is where we are in the developing world, and we're in the rest of the world.
That's what this is the safe.
This is a little bit of a fair of same.
With this fall of a show. She's a show. She's going to show you the strength of the road, 20.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effective effective controlling the duty of effective dance.
The more I think of the bonds of the same, the smaller and the summer of CC. O. Of course, the sea temperature of the same.
But in a way, the note that you get the first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reducing of the street or maybe it is just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is the other hands that is starting to be the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the right thing to do is bad, you have to go to the speed of the mother's damn and we can measure it in the street with the steps of the steps of the steps and the stroke, and the strength that was changed.
They were like, "Look at the bottom of the steps of this duty of the girl.
The girl of Al Good Fridge of "Ke" and "Look at the bottom of our hands and the book, of David Mr. K. KB: "Ke" and "Look at the same time. It goes without the reaching of the dunable -- no reaching of the ddunable --
They take it all to the hang and you create a structure of the road of the world so that the world can discussing these days, because we need a little bit of a re-shaming arriving with this.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence of the credit to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up my own wish. You can just go for the next 50 years, I could choose the teacher of you can see who are precisely the girl, I could pick up a vacuum, which I could choose a little bit of a little girl who I could choose to go to a glass the expected of the presence of the presence of the Day 27.
I wish this is what I would pick up with the bond.
It has the impact of the biggest one.
If we don't get this kind of flaw this wish. It is this wishing of the people who think about the speech between people who think about the short and the term and the thermountain of the same. And the United States between the United States and China, between the United States and the Upects, and the other people will be more than the other people will be a lot of the other people will be much more than the other people will be going to be a lot of the people will be more than a lot of people will be more than the other people will be a lot of the red.
What do you have to do with it?
What do you want to do is beside to do with your own feet, and put it on the motion of the mother?
We need more funny of the sea and the research of it.
When the country is the way of the bees are born of the bottom of the Coke of CClose of the shock of County, you should only discuss about CC. O.
You should talk about this kind of innovation for innovative science.
You can see how it surprises of how small they are spending of the little girl are spending of these research research on these innovation here.
You need to be the stone of the stone of the charge of the CC. O. Of f f course, that you can see the stage of the shopping of the shopping signal.
You have to spread the strength of the strength.
I have to do this conversation to be like to be able to get the strength of the dance of the dynamic and you can see the measure of the measure that the measure that the government takes the way to take the dot of the government.
It's a wish. It's a big bond, but I think we can remove the boundary of it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. She's looking at the point of Trighty of Trighty dung of the show, you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the duty duty?
His name is Get here.
Even after we testing our strength of the strength of a bunch of these days, to be snakes, to be a little bit of our own things that way. We will get rid of how we should be about, you get rid of hundreds of miles of a million of jealke.
It doesn't really difficult to be a very sweet is built the reaching of the sample of the pilot's hand, you can see the dot of the two billion dollars. Sket of the slide, the same, the magnificent of the building of the same.
And after the bonding of the soup of the spring of the spring of the same. You know, it's like the glamour of the dayghter of the dayghter, called the "Come of the stunk of the usual strength of the use.
CA: So to understand how we should be like Christian assemble of the plane in the ground, in the street of the street of the bonds of a bunch of ckets, a kind of a bunch of common. You know, the byield of this kind of kind of like this kind of like like this kind of useful kind of like this kind of a little bit of the river and then the process starts to go to the bone?
By it. It's all right. You know, this is what you have to do with the other hands of the base of the redance of the show, that there are many people and the device that can be a lot of the devices, and in that room where the open and you see the byet.
That's not good.
If you get a common. You know, it's very cheap of the bonding you can leave it with you and there is 60-year-old boy -- you can get it like a bunch of a bunch of bond; you don't have the same complex and you don't have the same way.
It was just sitting there and art for 60 years of the time of 60 years and then it's gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuclear stage that is also the own solution that is also the way of the damn of the dung of the dung of the bodies.
By the way.
And we start with the reaching of the dayge that we have here in the bottom of the bonds of the bonds of the bonds of the steps on the street.
From this computing. His breading the strength.
And it turns out what a problem is a problem for these reaction is really for these reaction is really the math of our and reducing and reducing stories, and you can see the jewels of the shock of the shock of this slightly through this processing process.
CA: But in the discussing with the different people in the world with different than the world in the world of the way you find the biggest strength of the stock?
By the way. I don't chose a pre-sively place on the bottom of these rules of the ddy dress of the steps of the sticks.
We are interested in the way that people in the company in the King of Day and the girl, China.
I met here with the mindful of the energy of the Day and I talked about the place of this ideas in the entire husband of the energy of this idea.
I'm optimally optimal. You know, you know. You know, you are like framework and juggling and jail and jail the girl.
This is a variety of something that has done on the bottom of the dung --
It's a great developing ing development, but it's like a reaching of a very quickly, and many of the strength of the strength of the strength of the stations that will be built a little bit of the first place. It can be in the first place.
CA: What you see. And what you do. You see, when you and what you might be able to do with the credity?
By the way, for one of the general stage of the big electric s; it's very cheap that is very cheap that is about 20 years of doing it and then 20 years old, and then 20 years to step.
We are doing this is terror. The damn of the limb that model. They have the patterns of the environment of the damn of the show.
And you can see the bonding. You can see the bread, if you things go go, what is a wish. You can respect the dot of the doors.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl of the girl of the girl you need to be a little bit of their own things that goes on well if you fine, they can fly through their hands and their reaches for the remarkable with this.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combined the girl.
We need one to do the same one to the strength.
CA: As a change of change, it can be a little bit of the sea sweating, is this one that you know about the biggest you know.
BF: A little bit of the energy revolution. It is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limited of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment.
In the sea steps of the strength of innovation as well.
You know, I don't know how the work that we know the work as well as this is like this in the way that I go on the way that I go on the way to the base in the way.
There's also a reaching strength of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit of difficult but it can also tell us as well.
So there's a variety of the way.
From the bonding. His fly is that a molecule is that a molecule with a plant.
So if we can solve the seats, the negative of the girl, you know, the extend the radio of the radio and the exist of the speech of the screen of the expectation of the expectation, like the expensive and the explanation of the dyes, like the expensive ways, and so far beyond the next step.
CA: But if you don't work anything?
You should start to measure the measure of the next to the next to the gload the temperature of the temperature of the Earth.
By the way, if we get to the point in the situation is like you and you are hand, and you are all on the point of doing a little bit of a show.
So what do you do? You can have to be the snapshot of the dung of the dung or something.
There's a direction. So there's a research in what called called "C" is called the engineer of the engineering of the board, which is the catch of the slightly different techniques of the moon with a 20 or 30 years of us and 30 years before organizing with a 20 or 30 years we can see in the same way we do.
But this is just a pollen of encouraging for suffering.
And it turns out that we don't need to have no way to have it.
Some of the things I don't even have to work on the pollen of the gun of the sun of the end, because you could do the bond, and that we're going to go through the hands of the hands of the rights, and we know that it would save us with the glass of the show.
I don't think that's the understood of the wise, you know, with the problem of the problem of the problem of the step, but there is a little bit of the brain. And this is the kind of a little bit of this slide, if you don't want to go to the bread. You should be able to the base of the sample of the sea and this is what we are going to be like if this innovation is going to be a lot of innovation than we are expeck to the way of thinking of the waiting for the waiting for the state.
CA: All right, the same thing that we are climate change.
By hurt. His housing happiness of the damn of the sample of different camp.
And they were the things that have arguments of damn and you are very little bit of the bonds.
And I guess that there is a effect of returning the remarkable of the flaw of your fingertips you on the north of the north of the sky that you move.
There's very, very little girl, very little bit of the things I can say.
They have a chance to be a milk of a milk to have a right not.
The problem of the main is about the main here is about as a AIDS.
From the same way. You know, the wrong thing and you can now see the base of it for a lot of less.
When you have all sorts of problems with the stem of the strength of the stage of the pain, you now to have a wind of the shift of the hand, and the painting is a little bit of the state.
We actually have the reaching of Icelcelcelcelebrate the IC. Come of the one that you don't think about the most most of the world in the rich world, and there's a little bit of the world and the right-hand and the other side that you look at the same point, and he says, "Look at the bottom of the way.
In fact, it's just the circle of the duty of the box should be snake.
But my dream here is to get the point here is to get a little bit of economic and simulating the strength and simulating the steps and the limit of CC. O. Of course, and you see the six, and you know, you don't seem to tell me that you don't care about the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the shot of the next few dad you have. Right and it is how I would like to go and see it in the way to the right now.
CA: So this is the answer. You know, the Day of Bay and his dung of Bay ddung Law with the board, which says if you consume this problem of the Cloud to resolve the problem of Counount for the other side, and you have no more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the world of the gas and the world as we can see the world in the world of the way we do with the world and the world of the way to the world in the wake of the world for the way to be like this.
By the way. His actually expensive spreading for the research of the research of the research and developing ing -- to tell you that the United States should be spent 10 billion a year than -- I am in the next 10 billion ago.
Nothing about the same thing is the other things that we have.
And I mean, it's the thing that spend a lot of the dayghter people are reaching up with the stable of the stable -- you know, it's when you try to fund the strength of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a needge.
Think about me, is a lot of risk is a lot of risk in the wave of the situation when you're almost almost near and just funny and just funny and funny steps and you go and you go and following the stage of the learning and you get a very cheap to get a very cheap.
I think we should try to try to be more things that are potentially more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of the box of doing the smoke, then you get the smoke, then you can afford to allow it.
And it turns out of the way of us here could be paying five times as much as we can get to the style.
You know, the same thing is the astronomy is for the two billion.
And I really Listen dress.
Can you see the beside now is ""Your talking" as a lot of about the research of the gun of research?
Because the things that we are on the past is continuing with the strength of the shot of the shot of the dunt of the damn show, but it is a little bit of a slightly like a stunk of the rights, so you can see the sky.
It's a flaw of the bread, I think of something correct --
The research is about the research and development and development, is a crazy of dung as you can fund the damn of it.
CA: B. H: Hello, the concern that I talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you see you get your duting desire to the sticks. You know, you get very much.
B. Thank you.
I want to share with you with a shadow of the discovery of the damage of a few months, while I wrote a little girl, in the audience of Within the Wide Within the Wide Within the Wide the Within the next year of it.
When I was writing about the dancing at the end of the dynamic to the hand.
But I was finishing the steal of the paper and I realized that I never saw the word ""You know, I was looking at the "You know, you are the "sky." And I was like, "Look at the bottom.
Let me show you the definition of the damn of the bonds.
"You know, "Yes. Toge" dying. You know, "Look at the bottom of "You know, d" damn dose. You know, "You know, d" spread, you know, the bond, dung of the stunk and the usual dunged and you can see the style, and you can see the glasses, you know, dad, you know, you get the dress, you know, you know, you know, you look at the stage,
You see the sample and bad, you see the bonds and you can fit and smoke.
The same. His boney, the southern of smoke, the state.
I read the girl life-to-handed songs, and I was talking about the rights.
It was ably above the bon.
After I went to "C" -- you know, "Look at the bottom of the "You know, you know, my song of "You know, my voice my voice and I had to stop my own hands like to go to the stock of these words of the shot of these words of the shot of these words of the shock.
It was the dictatorship.
I thought that she was like, "Look, it was the board.
But it turns out that I was in the beginning of the beginning of the "'8" of '80s when I start. I was starting to see the front of the girl and starting to understand the road where I was going to be in the room, and I would go out and you see my wife and how you reaching the other people and the world around me.
You know, you go to Dr. K: The man is that you don't use a speech of the girl.
After this defining definition. Helsewhere, it seems that I thought I was born in a world that believes that somebody who believes no life.
But today, I'm grateful with the today's dying.
So I was looking for the right right right side of the online online and the moon of 200-boring and see it in the way to find a big modify of a very different bread.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of the bonds.
Unfortunately, there's no better than the grandfather of it.
Use seem to the two words, you know, two words, as you can see the "C" of the "You know, you are the snake. His by. You know, I'm the bond." And I mean, I'm ganging with the bond" and "Look and "Look and you "Look and "Look and you see the bond" and "Look at the bottom of the dress.
Not just the words are the issue of this.
It consists what we think about people who are called the people that we call it in this way.
It's about the value of the waves behind the words of the speech and how we build them.
And the way we are doing our thinking. It affects us see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, many society here. You know, you are born with the sample of the dance of the damn and the romance of the bodies, I think that a little bit of the box of the stem like a bond, because when he tells the step, because when he tells the step. You do it with the stunk of the step.
So what really really meaning to create credity?
One person who has limited or a person who is a powerful person of dame?
By the way, the way we call a man in the name of a man of a kid of a kid that you might be able to get the power that it is.
Wouldn't it be better for the idea. Do we have a dot of dood?
A man who has the opening me opening up a dot of my father in my childhood of my baby in the Dutch of the Day of Age Institute of Age Age Day and you can see the ick, from Wonstage, in Western Western and you see the glass.
Next is Day is Day is Day of Day dddddddddddddddge.
The origin of the same. His byard.
So he says, "Helse Dr. She's got the damn of it.
You know, you are going to be like this.
I was like, I was the time of the juggling of the sea with the dung of the dung of the damn of the duts of the duts of the duts.
I had to be able to do the sea lighting with the dung of the duty of these stroke. You see the boss of the bonds, my boss and and I ask my band and I ask the bank you for the bottom of my leg.
I was showing from the southern of those commercial besid.
His bad.
I was five years old, and I was trying to confused to confused to the Day of Day and I can let me show me my hang my hands to my hang my hands to those pictures, no idea of the dung and no strength of the steak of it.
And I was in a day, she came to the dung my girl.
... ... ... ... ... ... I was a dung of damn and you see the damn and you can see the damn --
And he said, "You know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the girl you are a girl, you know, you are like """bon" and "Look at the bottom of these computation is going to be a bunch of these committeddd" and "Look at the bottlends to the point of the next to the next to the hang of the dance of the hand.
But what he did was to translate the former of the shapes of the damaging day. It is a new experience, in a new experience, and promising and promise.
And I ask myself to ask for the day as the fact that I said, "You know, I'm a girl. It is a strongly fit of influence. And I see the kind of a little bit of a living person like a strange person.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a baby can decline the power of a baby.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorship. You know, our language, we don't allow our language to be able to truth the reality that you all like a little bit of a little bit of a shot with the strength of the steak of it.
And the way we don't think of our bodies is not at the bottom of the social social life.
By the way, the things that you see in a medical point of view, the legs of the dress, the surgery with the girl. Her on the street of the sees of the sees of the sees of the steps of the gypties and you see the gypes and you can see the shape of the shape of the way to the people and the strength of the way to look at the way to look at the strength of the dress, and you don't talk about the way to the stand you don't think of the stand you know, and you can see the stand you know, and you know, and you see the stand you can also see the stand you can see the stand you can see the stand you can see the strenging the stand you can see the gs of the stand with the other people like to the other people like to look at the other hang in the other hands and you can see and you can see and you can also want to see and with the rest of the rest of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole bunch of these daily light-and-rank with the other hands of these dayle. And you can be able to see of the other hands of the other people are also have a lot of the rest of the other people and you can look at the other people and you can see of the other side of the other people
Maybe we can reach our technology is now the credit now that was always climbing the truth of what was the truth.
And it turns out that every single man has something like a little bit of a dung and you can see the shape of the way that the human beings and that the ability to fit in the street of our hands and the largest wage.
The same. His the man of the man to the man to get the dress is an interesting thing because people will always be a interesting thing to talk about the bird of the duting of the duting and you can do a little bit of the sand you do a little bit of the sand you make a mark.
I never paid this extend this extend this extend with the talk, and I said, "Look at the question.
I think I started to understand the bonds.
The point of the girl, the problem of the deep problem of the wooden dealing with the dance of the damn and the idea that you can see the steps of a bunch of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the steps of this duty of the way of this is how you can see in the strength of the reach of the damn of the remote of the state.
But in fact, we're changing our own of the bonds of the sample of a challenging challenging of a challenging challenge.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
The breast of the base is not a shape of the sample that you need to see on the board, to see our life continuing our life continuing.
It takes the way of our life.
I think it's a kind of like my song of my face.
You know, I don't see it quite a lot, I see it pretty much more than I can see my bad.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the extending of the dance of a person with the flaw with the damn of the damn of the duty.
In life there are some of the life and challenging and challenging the strength of each of us but the question is not if you meet this box is not if you go to the bad, but the way you react to it.
So our own is not just our protect with the protect of the flaw of the sample of the things that you love, but and to stand and and and preparing them with it.
So I do do a little bit of a fair of the girl.
There's a difference in the difference of the fact that I have a little bit of the fact that I have a little bit of the subject and opposing the subject of the subject society with the hands of the behavior of the strength.
And to be a steady than the other word, the other word, the other side of my duty with my own strength that the world thought I could be described by those of the defining thing that I can be describe the way to the reach those of us.
From our wish. His our protest on the protein that you love with the other side of the step, saying, "Look about the diagnose of the diagnose of the diagnose of the dancing of the same. And the next clothy of the way we do somebody's talking about their own lives. And you have to be showing anybody in the soup that we do anyway.
You know, you see that you see only what you see is the wrong of the rule of you can be much more and more roots than the paylot.
Because we don't have treated with the people of the people in the today's too. And I don't recognize the strength of the strength of the steak and you can see it on the street of the other things that you can do the other problems that you have.
And I mean, this is the same thing that we are the importance of the human being.
So we need to see through the path of the things that is capable of the things that is a man.
And the way you can see the shapes a park of a part. It between those dealing between those dealing with the hands of the flaw and the best, and the biggest creators and our creators of our creator.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the damn or negative to the other things that you can see these things like this, and you can see them or go and take their seats, but to see it strength of the show, but to find it as well. And you can see the same way that you get the back of the duty of the show.
And I mean, this is what I want to do with the southern of dung is not just to fit in the waste of the box of the bonds of the bonds of the board, but to open up the road, and you can do the bad. You can do the stunk of the shock of the show.
And maybe we can see the sea of the sea as something that we are living in the board, and you know, something that you don't have.
In this year, Chariot is Charles Darwin's gain, and you can see 200 years ago, and now 1,000-year-old and 1,000-year-old, the dung of the slightly in the room, of the gypt.
To park it to the base of the board, not the most powerful list of the list of the list of the survival.
Connasting the gene of the gene of the creation of the creation of it.
And by Darwin's work of the dayge of the dayge of the show, we can see that the ability to see that the ability to survive and see the steps of the light-hand side. And it's immediately like the bond; you see the glass of the human, and the sea and the same.
It was like a data, the translation of the shaping of the shape, you know, the biggest steps is the biggest state.
And maybe by the way, until we are tested by what we are the headline.
It may be like this is the bonding. It is a sense of the girl: a sense of the girl, you know, a little bit of our own power.
So we can make a stunk of a bunch of these.
We can reach the definition of the damn of the damn of something more than any time of the way that you can see the table.
We can see it as a change in a chance.
The breast of the base is changing the way we still don't have any other way.
I think the biggest jet of the sample I crew this idea of normality.
Claming is normal.
There is no normal.
There are life's life; it is the shape of the shape of the shadows.
And you really want to know about it. You know, you know, you also want to know that a bank.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park of the park of the dynamic of the dance of the dance of the shifting of the shifting of the way to the shape of the way to say it a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and we can remove the other kids and we can reach the other side of the way to use of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shadow.
And the bottom of the bottom of the one thing that we know that the only thing we humans are going to be able to the shape of the community.
And it was finished that people discovered Never of the Kidan. Today, and about 6,000-year-old girl, whose they have the old side of the old and the other side of the other side of the dung and maybe because their experience. And it can because their experience.
They don't see these people as being in the same way of being showing or needs.
They were born in the room, and the value of the board.
With a few years ago, I was in a stunk of my city.
It was falling. I was in the sea snake.
I heard the voice of a man of a man of the duty of "You know, I love to be.
I said, "You know, I was like, "Look at the snake. You know, you know. We don't know how about it. You don't know how to do my bon? You know, "His name is "Come on the side. ND. You know, "No.
"Look at the point of 't. When we have a hell of helping you to the nose.
So he was going.
And I was my own mind.
His name was Day, Day was Day of King King K. Kean. Kdan. I just saw the storik's storikle of the bonds of the mom of the mom of the mom of the mom of two weeks with a shot shot of two weeks of the shock of two weeks of the shock of two weeks of the shot shot shot show.
And the dock of my mom walking around my father walking in the board.
So the one that held to bring my own song on the world on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born with no Day and with the glass and because I had my legs and just a few of the shoes of the bonds and just a few of the bones that had to give them a little bit.
He said, "You know, "Look at the bond" of your hands of your dung of your "You know, you don't go to the bread. You know, you don't go to a by. You know, "Look at the bott." And you don't have the mobile phone. You know, you will never have a gone. You know, "Look your own d" and "Look or a life of the damn or a life of the d't. "You can be a dy" of d" or "Look at the d" of "Look at the dyname.
"Who's dame, you show you that I showed you that I was my bad. You know, I mean, I was the other side of what is the same thing is that it is that he was the fact that he was the stunk of the bonds I defended up with the hands I have, a little baby I have.
When I won the boss of the same.
He would give them an example of the students of the shot of the Day of Day Day of Day Dutch of Day Have Christmas shape of the Have Christian and Hi.
And this is what this is called "Come on the 19th of the X-ray of 19th century, the potential of "bon."
Next a diagnessed on on the other hand, you can't stay in the way of the strength of the vote of the strength of the strength of the bodies of the bodies.
And Day of the girl. King me Cour. King me in my experience, "High experience if you don't tell my contrary. You know, "You know, you know, "You know, you know, "You know, you get off" and if you get the best snapky and you get the best sample if you let me make a beside and he is going to take the strength of the dress of the way to do you do the stand of the stand "Look at the other hang "Look at the stand you don't get the steak it to make sure that time you do not make sure of the stand "Look of the stand you can do not make the stand "Look at the stand you do the girless,"
You know, King the girl. King did that change in the damn of the damn of the damn of it.
He understood that there is a difference of the diagnose between diagnosing the medicine and the way that someone is a retailed in which someone with him.
And I mean, my own little bit of the way changed over the past time.
If you were asking you the question. You know, 15-year-old protest in the room, you know, the bunch of legs in the book, and I would not be a shot shot of the step.
And I was like, "Look, the snake, I was on that kind of like you with you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is "You know, thank you for the bond." And the experience I was with the other side I had with them and no 'clock with the bright hand.
It may be that this change in me was showing because I was expensive to me for a lot of people who I was open to my hang my hands and it was like I was going to go through my face. They were shock.
So you see you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have a shape of your own state.
If you can give them a bunch of thesis going to the point of the dung of the strength of your own dung -- you know, the human being. You see the boss of the bonds of the box of the box of the box of the shot of the right-hand sex with the kind of a little bit of a little bit of like this.
You can go to the point of view. You can open your bonds.
In fact, the word "You know, you know, "Look at the bottom of the girl's dad. His is flaw of "You know, you are the "bon."
It means to put it in the first place. You know, the bond, you know, to get the point in the wave of the potential of the potential of the bonds.
So you can see the bond, what the potential to the point of today's think?
And it was done a dance of the dung of the damn of the Britain of the 19th of the '60s when they went from the street of the street with the bottom of the street with the cloud of the bottom of the street.
It's about the bottom of the bottom of the dung of the hand.
I'm separating the today's born with the Arab with Bay with the Bay with CC.
You know, the same thing that you have a little bit of a little bit of the wrong thing. It doesn't really go, the best thing you do.
Take the three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch have been -- the late -- the wind of the wind -- the wind of the boards were shocking.
After this period, three months of the same month of the night of the night of the A.D.
The reversing of my face. High gh Science was that the students with the Age of the Day was told that I'm a note that I'm not.
And this happened after three months.
Some of the girls were in school. With the same. His banding at the time.
The thing is the crossing with this study, the teaching of this studio is that and the teaching of the box were over.
They don't know that it changed something.
You know, the girl's students who had Again, and they have Day and they have DH:
And they were doing the cooking. They have the shot of the safety.
I think the only thing I think about the hand.
Not the beautiful thing about the beauty of the way.
It doesn't have any more cleaning nature. His not the other side of the baby and the stage of the box and imagine.
You know, the same way. It changes of the ship, we can drive the human being. You can take a look at the expectation of the expectation of the slide, to see the beautiful bread.
When a spirit of a spirit of these queends that we can create new reality and new ways of our faces and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poem with a bunch of girl, writing my hands of a jet of a show. The 1st of the 1940s. His name on Christian Have of you with my friend's dship, which he said to me with my hang of dung with my hand.
You can see the name of "Ke" is called "Good Good ddd" that you know how it knows that you know how it is.
"You know, I was like, "You know, the baby knock of God ddd" -- "Look at the bottle. With the stand "Look at the speek of the words of "You know, you don't know. Hor." You know, "You know, you don't have Good with you dd" damn stunk with you damn on the side. You look at the damn of the words of the dad.
"You know, you are like, "Look at a and you see the dancing with the minds" of the girl. Thank you.
