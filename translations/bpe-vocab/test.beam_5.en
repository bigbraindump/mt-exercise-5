A few of them are going to be a few years ago, here at TEDstage of TEDster Christian issue called the Human named a bunch of design.
And the idea is quite simple.
You see the facts of four must be built by four has to build.
By the way, you have to go to the top of the bottom of the top.
And it turns out, and it looks pretty simple. And it turns out that it is really hard, because the shape of the people to collect very quickly.
And so I thought this is an interesting idea that this is an interesting idea.
And it was a great success.
And at that point, I have almost 70 strength of the shaming of designing around the world with my students and designing and designing and designers, and designing architecture and architecture. And this is a 50-handed and something in this shock and something in this hand, and something in this slightly in the shock and something like this is about nature, and you look at the right-hand.
So, normally people start by avoiding the task.
RB: You know, you see how he imagines her -- he imagines how it will show you how it would look at the seem to be. And then they spend some time on the planet.
She's gone. And it goes on and throw it up and throw it up to the bread.
They fit around.
But what happens in most casually, in most casualties, is that "Look at the bottom of the girl, "Look at the bottom of "bone," because of the hous," because of the board."
And there is a number of people who have a lot of the momentous momentum of "Christ."
They are the mind, the trip. She's gone.
You see, of course, there are some of the other side that they have a lot more structure of structure. And this is the bonds of the best, and these are the best, and they are the best, and you get the best.
And it's pretty amazing.
And as you tell us then. You know, not only the produced by the way, but the most interesting structure, and the most interesting structure.
So you want to ask the question: How do you know?
And he would like to say, "I love to say, "Look at the bottom of one of the kids don't lose the time I don't lose the speech of the Skkkkkkkk."
And you don't lose the time of fight by the way.
But there is another reason.
This is that the students are training are training to cover the same.
And it turns out it out.
And what happens is that when you put on the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the fish, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Is it a little girl? Right?
What I do is doing is different from the garden. It is that they start with the gangs starts with the window, and they're building step.
So design.
And every version of the girl, the children have an answer to the point of course of what it works, and what it doesn't work.
So this is the ability to build the strength of the prototypes is essential.
So the majority of these, is about 20 countries.
Right?
It looks like this.
And why is this? Because they understand them? Because they understand the triangle of the dung and the patterns and models and patterns of the geek step. It's the kind of a bunch of structure.
So, the direction of the speech of speech, slightly better than the environment.
But this is where it becomes interesting.
If you add it too.
It's incredible.
Can you look at this dinner. And why is it too. And why can you see?
Because they have the steps of this.
I mean, I'm going to take the process, you understand the process.
And any of the team that mone.
Comming.
If you have 10 teaming that begins to build. And if you start to build the road, you will have this structure.
And I tried something interesting.
And I thought, okay hair, you know, we're going to raise your dun.
And I off.
And what you think it happened with the same thing that happened with my students in designer?
What was the result?
Here's what happened.
Next. It doesn't build something that was not built something that was going to stand in the leg.
If it was a little bit of a little bit of building, to say, you know, a structure structure of three days, it would be able to take a little bit.
So, it's not interesting that the sample of big impacts have a strong?
And I was finished by the way.
What does it happen?
You know, I think they have done the value of the profound value of this.
And the same way. And the same thing from the southern from the southern of the best result of the best result.
They have covered the road, the other struck struck struck in the short of time.
So here's some lessons of the bottom of the speech of nature.
So, you could ask the question: Why could you lose anybody and you lose the issue of someone like this.
And the reasoning is, I help you see the shape of the shape of the digital hands and the process of using the speech and processes. They use the shape of what you built.
And what does this challenge.
Because, in fact, every project has his own baby.
And this challenging challenge.
And so you know, this is the value of this experience.
And for the one of the other hand, you can get access to the wisdom of the wild of the dung of the bread. Hello. This is a bunch of glass. This is a blog where you can see how to build you see how to build you see how to build.
They are also the struck struck with the strength.
And I'm also talking about this kind of needle of all around the world of how humans change in the world of how people are changing the system.
You can look at the record and record.
And the lesson, I think it's the fact that it is the fact that design is really a sport.
We're going to be able to break the strength of the sample of all the feeling of what we have, and appreciate what we have better thinkings, and the factories, and the factory of the challenge.
And it turns out, you know, a little bit like this.
And that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's look at the point of view, we have a card card on the board, a machine, a big car.
And all of the same. You see it in this room, you have to go to the point in it.
You can go back or before you go back and forth, but you can't remain is where you are.
I wonder what I'm going to be. You know, I mean, you know, I put my friendships, and I put my friends in the last slightly and all wanted to be.
I don't know. She's going to go back to the beginning of the invention of the shock of the talk, before the other side of the Ice or "I."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a little bit like this.
But I have to mention that I'm not part of this grassrow.
I don't want to go back. And I don't want to be in time and not because I don't have a spirit of adventure, but because I think of the option of the option of the option.
So, I want you to look at it in the car and go forward.
This is the best of this plane of this plane of this planet, you look at the box of the box of the box of the box of the best, beside and the stage.
It doesn't exist.
Everybody. You know, my grandfather died before I died before I died before you get 6.
By the way, my grandparents got to 70s.
So my hand, my parents are close to the sees of 8.
So it would be good to exist. It's a nuts at the beginning of the bottom of the bottom of that I'm going to die.
But it's not even about humans and new, because it's much more important than that.
A baby who is born in New York City today.
Go bad. You see, it's an incredible phenomenon. This is an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it true?
She's gone.
And it turns out that the philosophical data.
No.
I have gone.
In the rich world, you know, the sample that threatens of millions of people with just a generation.
DH: Hellof, beside bread.
You know what?
Very the way.
And I think about it as a meeting scientific methods, he put things on the road, which, you see if it works, you see if it works, it is one of the most achievement, it's one of the most achievement.
These are seen.
Unfortunately, there is no longer and there are no longer and other things because there are other people's issues, one of the mention of many times, one of them is that weird up with all of our shadows, a billions, a billion people are fighting every day.
This number is very fast, and it's very fast, and it's going to be justice.
It's not just like this, but we used to use the imagination to destroy this planet.
She's gone of the same, you see the strength of the strength of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hands of the hands of the rights, you know, I'm all on the bread, you know, I'm all on the side, and they will disappear.
If we are not inventing a little bit of a way to come up and out of this room, and in this room, we're going to fall of us.
Look at this point, right? Can we do this: Can we do this? I think yet.
I think it's obviously, that we can produce food that we can produce foot that we can eat the bottom of bills of billions of people without the earth of the ground.
And I think we can run this world with this world with energy.
I really think this is not just a lot.
But here's what I'm not going to want to wandering with the novel -- one of the things that I don't leave me with it.
I never had a bigger progress that you need a lot of progress than now and we haven't been able to use it in the situation of the way to use it in the way that we can do today.
We're in the prison of a little bit of a lot.
All right, and I think we should go back, and I think we should come back with three hundred years ago, before E.
People are cross of the same.
Nothing about the truth is not going to release.
Everybody's right here.
You don't have it. You don't have your own right to your own state.
And it took me something like this.
A hundred years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines about the vaccines for "The New York" for "The New York City.
I was watching the same way.
I did not know what to do, I did to do with him, so I did what I do is use.
She's gone after these days, I wrote a article about a piece of paper dose.
Think about it as well. And the same thing as it is just more important.
People were going to take off the road.
So I wrote a piece of paper, and this is what I could not understand with how humans thought of how people thought it was "Christian."
But, as you know. You know, I do what I'm doing, I did what you do.
I mean, I'm a little bit of a dyname; you look at today; you look at the bottom of the girlfrighten, and all of the step.
But these articles. They were meeting and I can't see my damn and you realize which, I realized which, I understand.
She was because she was sick, she was showing my hands that I would go out of my mind. You know, there were no flag in my mind.
They were boring people with my granddaughter, you know, the girl,
They were just like the people in this room, the people in this room.
And I guess my bread.
But then I was thinking.
We're in the point where we don't have the same way we don't have the same way to progress with progress.
RB: You can fall of us with the flaw of it.
You can see the bonds of it. We are about it in the terms. You see it in the same. You can put it between the glasses between the glasses.
Okay, there are reasons for that and I think we know what these reasons.
We were gone. I have lost the conference in the institution in the institution, in the authority and sometimes even in the science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can fall of you can see a couple of numbers, and people will understand.
She's gone. Helf. She's gone.
You can go to the other hand.
These are questions and questions and the issue of people who think they always have right.
So, you know, you are circle circumstances.
You know, you get the question, "Look at the bottom of the damage, you see the dot and you see it.
You don't have anything to go.
But here's what this idea.
And I can say that, because we're in the middle of a epidemic of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the street that I don't know how much and I don't see it.
An 12 years ago, he was published a paper of dying.
Very girl. Helf. Helf.
And they don't. They don't.
I really needed to be doing the sample of the shape of the dancing of the studies; it's an important issue of this.
They came up and the results.
RB: You see, there are some of the United States of the United States, in the United States of Britain, in South Britain, in South Cancer and all said to me the same paper and all of the same paper and all of the same thing: there is no climbing cool, there's no cloud, absolutely not.
I don't think about it.
We don't think a whole bunch of documentary damn documents from a network from a functioning of a little bit of a little bit of data that off.
But you know?
RB: You know, the girl, the girls were disappearing and here's what they were disappearing and here's what the United States, the United States is one of the world in the world, which is one of the village in the world in which routine.
This is the same. Helf. It should be.
It's great.
What happened to the point I was going to look like?
You know, I mean, you know, you really understand.
Does anybody here on the bottom here.
He saw someone in the audience on the other side of each other.
It doesn't really happen.
In this summer doesn't happen, but it doesn't happen, but it happened to 1,000,000,000.
A lot of a bunch of birds because of the bridge, 20 dollars, 20 cases, 20 cases, 20 cases on the top.
But, because here was not happening, we can not think about this and people like Jesus and humans like Jesge McKenyan. Cidamage, I can show you the stunk stuck stuck and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance and ignorance Law and ignorance.
And I can do that, because I don't do the difference between the cause.
They don't understand that these peak step, but not the same thing, but it doesn't see.
And we have to learn what we have to do.
And this guy, Jesson, Jessed.
It goes down to the bottom of one of the biggest snapshot of the human beings.
Next. Helf, no fingers; the policy of dose. Helf. Helf.
Take the town in the middle of the bottom of the bottom of it.
His name name name is Pay.
Take a little bit of what we developed a vaccine with a cockkroaching with a road.
She's gone.
All right, right?
This is the go, just that Paul talks about itself in the boundaries, and how they are the pregnant and how people should be. And that people should just slow.
And this is what they do.
So, Pake a little bit is a term.
And when Pay. When he talks in a audience in the audience, you can't fall of the snake, you can't fall of the same.
This is the soap because people like people like people like to say that I know what my children are going to school.
Why? Because Pay.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essentially the same.
If you go to the bread, you know, the bodies of the box of the board.
In this country, we have now related to the judge.
It's the more worse, and in the same, the kids are going to die again, because of that, you know, it's just a statistic.
And it's not going to die.
How do you stay with the rock of the sky of dying. What do you do? Let's go and look like?
Two weeks ago, there was a cold of fairly fairly facing my son, and he told me that I'm kind of crazy.
Nobody anybody else said to me anymore.
He didn't have a check and vaccinated with the baby against the pollen against the poll.
In any case.
OK.
Why? Because we don't have the pol.
There are no way that there are no way of the pollen.
But everyday I don't know. You know, a guy can go on the side of the morning in the morning in a planet.
Very there.
You don't know how it is infected by a disease with a disease that challenge that challenge.
This is the planning that we live. We don't pretend us by doing it.
We like to learn how to do we learn in the living.
It took the whole world of the speech of the world in the morning.
The Chinese dancing, you know, a little antique antify.
And I know you did this because half of the population of the United States.
You know, they have these things and steps on the medicine with the alternative.
It looks like all the same thing.
You know, I'm going to take a little bit of the endance of the box and usually nothing more.
It's okay, you know, you want to pay attention to 1,000-dollar lies.
Next.
Look at the beginning of the fact. She's going to be.
Why do we do this?
And I think you know, I think -- I'm going to the mark of the steps of the girls.
Look at the bottom of the start.
And you don't have to have any of you have.
It's the cross of millions of people.
This is incredibly fun of damn and destruction.
And so flowing around. And so you can be.
RB: You can see it in the arts of the same.
This is fantastic. This is fantastic.
But, in fact, it's a very seriously, because these things are because these things are tough.
I have here all kinds of objects.
Next. She's one of them -- the edge.
And you know? When you go? When you look at this, humans and you say, "Look at me and you say, "Look at this point, you know, you're going to be doing what I want to do with the people to do the people to be doing the right hand.
You know? You know? Thank you.
Because I don't care about it, if I secret my wife.
When you go on the road, you go on the road, you know, and the map and the magic and the same. Think about the strength of the strength in a place where you don't want to be a place where you want.
You can see the bonds in South Africa, in South Africa.
He killed 1,000-and-a-thousand-and-and-speech of glasses that judging on the road. Helse's stunk and bonds are much more effectively effectively more efficient than the medicine are effectively effective than the medicine than you know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know the slow.
Take a thousand deck of thousands of decades.
Please please, I don't tell you that there's no idea that there is no consequence.
It's all right.
She's the lack of the sample of the sample of the epidemic.
It's a controver.
It's a controver.
This is the idea, you don't science.
I mean, I have the hands of my hand, every task.
In the garden. She's gone.
And no fish.
There are no way that they were gone.
I did this in the last 1,000-year-old.
Sometimes they were on the rules of this.
I got down the road.
Now we can do it in a different way.
Helsewhere, there is the risk.
But we can put speech on the bottom of the waste, and that can help millions of people, and it can help millions of people, the pregnancy of these.
You don't want to do this?
I have to be married. I mean, I don't understand.
That's what we do. We are testing against the bottom of the modify of genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, you know, you always have. We always have.
We don't want to be.
We're not going to be able to be.
You know what I do you know is the answer to all this?
Yes, you have here.
This is how we have a big problem with hand, but this is not the science.
This is not.
It's the legs, it's morning, it's like this.
You know that science is not the science is not represented by a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea.
This is a process that sometimes works. It doesn't work, and the other hand, but the idea that you don't need to be able to allow them to be.
In the next 50 years will be going to have to be able to build with 70-year-olds more food than the presence.
70 percent of it.
This is what invested in Africa has been done in Africa in the last 30 years.
RB: You know, the dog.
They need that, and we don't need it.
Why? Why? Who's shift.
We don't want them to be. We don't want to eat people to eat the bottom of what I start.
500 million people eat the bottom of the same.
It's kind of like a chart.
Take the same.
Next. She's about the subject of gap. It doesn't look like this.
And then people will be able to eat it with no way to anybody.
Will not suffering, you know, and you know?
It would be good. No.
All right, what can I tell you this: Why can we go?
Could you be able to ask the question: Why is it like this: Why do we have.
Because we don't want to change.
It's just about the same thing about changed.
It's not about our strength of our lifestyle for the hormone.
It's not about the demand for the same.
Of course, you know what, you know what?
If you don't. If we are doing it.
We cannot describe something elsewhere else happens.
This is the today's bad, it is where it is under our level, and we even have to slow.
So, after this talk, this incredible talk, you know, incredibly destroyed, you can say, "Look, you can say, "Look at this point in this book, you want to go out in this book, you know, the stunk of the day?"
RB: Of course you know. Of course, yeah, yeah.
Now, this is what you do with the dung of the pressure of the present, but we have an opportunity but we have an opportunity.
We can programming. We can do the sees of any of you want.
We can move it out of the strength of it.
We need to have. We have these discussions and we have to think, but when we have to think about it.
I know that we can also see that we can see in my hand, I just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You see, in one day of the damage of Steve.
And it was a human, a human, an Africans.
And I tell you a whole story that many of you know, because Stew up and he wrote a lot of articles that became the bottom of a book, and then he made a film, with the R&amp;amp;D. H: Helf like Stepan. Helf. High Lok. And James and Jamamamp and Jamames like dance and Jamamamn and Jamn and and James like this. This is like Christian.
Next. She's gentlemen, and he was reached at the school, he went to the school, he went to a show.
Thank you very much like to put it on the side of Steve. Your charge or you can see speech or see the film and you can see the shopping of these two people, but you know, the other two people, but how the muscles of these two people, but how does it helps with these two people, and how he has been instrumentation, and as it was the instrumental, and then it was on the other hand, and it turns out that there was a little bit of the way that you help in the world in the world in the wake of the wake of the slightly other hands of these other hands of these other hand.
And I met my dad song on the stage.
Take a little bit of listening to the strength.
Very whatsoek in a very game in a very game and societies of Yet and societies of Yet and Hi. Top and Hi. Cary and HB: You know, how many of them are going to have never reached in the Duts will never reach up in the end, and all of a strength of a shock in the last slightly from the last slightly in the last hand.
I was talking about the muscle of the music. I got an email. I got a few days later at Steve. She's a couple of days later you were interested in the hands of a living.
Now, I have to mention that Next.
But, as a result now, it's pregnant to these fall of the wise.
The worst of them can eat the bottom of them as he explaining it as he explained it as he explaining a lot of these days, and the right-hand side, and you see it on the streets in Skkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkill of these juggling clearly with the strength of the right-hand side.
And Next.
And she was talking about the demonstration of the shock of the shock and girl, and if someone stopping him.
And I was frankly, not for me, but it was framing that I'm going to lose it.
So I started songs.
And I singing the first part of the concert of the concert of Zood's life.
And as I was singing my song that I understood that a change of speech of speech too.
It was like how it was influenced by some of the medicines of the narrative.
And the same.
And like in a bunch of dancing, and you see her own steps his own living, and he started playing with his son, and he started, some of the slightly in the concern of the concert of the concert of the concert that I got my rights, some of the right-hands that rightly rightly didn't. She's gone.
And I started to talk about the muscle of the Mount of Buddhist Being Christians, and Brazil, and Bra.
And I understood that he doesn't only had the knowledge.
You see the same.
And while I was on the bottom and I was talking about. I was talking about the human beings, this is transformed by a parkle of a paranzzy that you just came up with you on the street that just came out of the street on the street on the streets in the bottom of the river in the bottom of this muscle of the right-hand side of the dancing dress,
It's like this.
And for Next.
Because the music allows it allows them to take their own thinkings, and you can see them and you can see them the shadow and the creation and the creation and the creation and creativity, and the creation and creativity.
And this is an event. It is an event from the strength of the suffering.
And I understand. And I understood that this is the same.
This is the reason why we do the music we do the museum, we're doing something that we are in our fundamental narrative, our emotions and our emotions and our brains and our brains and our artists, with our artists, with our hands of these emotions, and we look at these emotions, and we are all those emotions of the emotion of these emotions.
And the reality of the steps of the expression of us, and you get us on the top, and you get us here.
And for Next.
You can finish the release of the muscle of the muscle of himself in a family.
I will always be doing the music with Net.
Thank you.
Thank you.
RB: You get the dung of the GD.
RB: You can see the same.
So, please.
I am Jessons of Yes. I'm going to be. I'm an end. I'm an designer. I'm an designer of the game.
I think about the game.
And my purpose for the next to the next decade is to try to the dot of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the world in the game.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it involves in the world, including more world, including the present of the pressure of the presented here, to spend a lot more time playing on the stage.
So at the point of view, we are three billion hours per week on the week of the shock of the shock.
So some of you might think about it, "Look, it's very much time of you can think about the game.
Maybe too much of the time it helps you see how how many problems you have to solve this gene in the real world, we have to solve the real world.
By the way, consistent, confidence of my dung of my dung dancing Instead, of course, is exactly on the bottom of this.
Take billions of hours on his hands on the bottom of the hands of the game.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive. We want to survive of the future. We have to go on this plane on this planet, we have to rain this planet, we have to raising this number of own.
I have computers everybody, which we need at 2,000-and-billions of play.
So, this is probably a little bit of a little bit like this.
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to leave it up with it.
If we want to solve the problems like fire. And if we want to be.
This is why. This picture of what I think is going to do with what I think is that playing the games are so essentially the steps are so essential.
This is a peak shot by a picture of a photograph called Pllll.
He wanted to come up with the emotion of the emotion of the show.
So here's the shot of the shot shot in front of you in front of the today's play.
And this is an emotion.
Now, if you are not a rubber of dance could lose a part of the shipping of this photograph of this photo.
And it turns out that nobody notice that you new, you know, you neither dance of duty, but it focuses on the board, but focused on your hand, your hands for a very strong, you know, a very difficult issue for a very difficult issue for a very difficult problems.
If you are a today's playing. You can see some of the fingertips a few of these days, you like this.
And the same.
This is a hair.
All right, you have heard of that. OK. OK.
So we have something like this.
A window. It's a little bit of a little girl, which is so extraordinary of the picture, you don't believe that you don't think you can touch it.
It was almost beyond the bottom of the board.
And when you reach out there you are so sweet to discover that you are really going to discover that you are a joke.
This is a too.
And this is the face that we need to see in the milk of the people that solve the people who solve you with the world as we try to remote around the world as we try to remove the next century.
Helsewhere. Helf. His going to be who, with you know, it's on the way to get a window.
So now I'm sorry, this is a face that is a face that we see more often in our lives, as we see in our life expectancy.
This is what I call """Look, I'm not good at life."
And this is where I do this stuff, he makes this fair. You can see you? Yes. Can you go.
This is really what I do is doing. I am not good at life."
Here is a piece of fish. It flows in the box of my neighborhoods.
In Bero.
And this is a problem that many games you have.
You know, we are not as good as we are not as good as we are not as good as we are in the game.
And I don't refer to my grandfather as "["] ["] [unclear], even though this is a component of the games than in the games than in your own games than in the reaches of doing something that I refer to to do something that I refer to do something that conconconfidence of doing something that confidence to collaborate with the other day.
And when we are in the world, I think that many of us start that many of us become the best version of ourselves, the most disappeared in a moment to help you see in a database, the most likely to be able to build a slightly as a problem as if it's necessarily like to right-hand issue as a slightly after a step.
In the real life, when we're kidn't. And you can see in front of you.
We feel like this.
We feel like this.
We don't have any sense of the feeling that we don't have any sense of when we play, they are just not in the game.
So, this is what I wanted to do when I was finished when I find.
What is the game of the games are doing is doing a sense of feeling like this safety of a safety of what can we do?
How can we take these sentences in the games in the games and applies and apply them to the work in real life?
So I looked at the games of the games like the World Wase of With With With With the dress, which is really a cold environment.
And I started to see a couple of things that I do won the wisdom of the wisdom of the damage.
So, the first thing is that, anywhere else is that, anywhere in the hand, you know, one of these kinds of online games in the World War breads in the World War k bake, meetings, you know, a lot of personal personal character, and you know, there's a lot of character that I'm willing to be.
But not any missing. Helf, but a perfectly missing with your fingertips in your game.
So, you can go to the same.
I'm never going to give you a trip that you can't remove it.
But this is the limit of what you can do. You see on the board.
But there is no check in the World War II.
There is no state.
There's always something clearly clearly than done.
And also, they also are a collection of the collaborative approach.
Of course, the point where you go, hundreds of thousands of people who are going to work with you to work with you to work with you to work with you in the same.
It's not something that might be able to easy.
And in addition to it, it's also this story, and this story of the daughter, this story of inspiring about what we're doing, and what we're doing.
And then you get the same.
You have heard of growth in the level and the level of strength and pleasant to the strength of the shape of the intelligence.
We don't receive the girl's feeding conference in real life.
When I go to this stage on this stage, I'm not going to be plugged at the speak of the talk, and pleasant ideas on the road, in fact, pleasant idea, there is a couple of living ideas.
I don't receive as girls in the real life.
Now, the problem with the environmental issues like the World War III. His like the World War k is that this is that it's so satisfy to be on the shock of the shock of a little bit of a little bit of all the time that we have a little bit of all the time that we have all the time in these glass.
It's just better like in reality.
So you know, by the way, until now, in the collection of the World Wase of the World War k of the World War IIII. Hello. Hello, 30-year-olds and the virtues of the slightly slightly showing the issues of the slides of the shock.
Now, this is not necessarily anybody.
It could sound like like if it was a bad thing.
But I'm going to put that in the context of 5: 500,000-year-old girls that our first steps our first step.
The girl was the first one was the first steps that stayed in the leg.
Okay, so when we talk about how much time we're talking about how much time we are playing the games of the game, the only way that meaning the sense of what it makes us think about it right now, is to talk about time in the magnitude, what this is an extraordinary, what is an amazing thing is an extraordinary.
But this is the right thing. Because it turns out that you can see that by spending through the shape of how much time playing the game, we're really changing the game, we're really shipping of what we are capable of what we are going to do with the human being.
We are evolving to a spectrum of a little bit of collaboration.
That's true.
So, you know, you look at this data, this statistick of the damn interest.
It was published by a recent research at the University of New York City.
I mean, the other side of you.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours is a very interesting number of reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States. Today's 10 hours is the number of hours that you're going to spend on the school, which you're going to spend on my hands in my classrooms and until finally finish. You know, if you never lack of the street.
So we have a whole bunch of glass. You see the park of my education that people are going to happen in which the people are going to look at the way that people need to be a lot of about what you need to be a bunch of what you need to do with the rest of the rest of the street.
And some of you may probably be reading reading the nuting of MGee.
So, you're going to be heard of the dunt of the sample of 10,000.
It's based on the same. You can look at this extraordinary research.
We're going to be as good as we do as well as the largest character in the world.
And that's what we're looking at is a whole generation now is a whole generation of humans who are today's players who are today's playing.
And so, the great thing is, "Look at the question is, "Is it the today?"
Because if we could figure out this, we had a resource of human.
This is a few people have now in the world that spend in the world that spend at least on the other hand.
These are the girls are the game.
500 million people who are extraordinary.
And in the future. We're going to be another billion of the today's going to be a glass that are extraordinary.
If you don't know how you don't.
Suddenly fall of the game.
They estimate that one billion of the games of the shock of the shock of the shift.
This will bring us to 1,000-billions of play.
So I started to think about what I do these games do these games.
These are the four things that we discovered.
OK.
Of course, the point of view. She's gentlemen, this is wishing is wishing to the strength of a shock in front of a bunch of glacier you on the bottom of the shock of the shock that we have a chance that we have a same.
You know, I always have credn’t believe that a window. I always think that a little bit of itself, and I'm going to try to try.
You know, they don't stand you see the bonds of the boss of the bread.
RB: You know, I'm an expert in the clock of a glass of a duty of social dying.
There are a lot of studies that look like we like people more than if we played with a game with them, even if you played us with them, even if you look at the board.
And the reasoning is that it requires a lot of trust.
We have gone.
And so, you know, playing with a game with someone with a game with someone really building with a shadows.
And as a result, we are building with social relationships, the societies.
You can go to the same.
You know, there is a little bit of the game that played the environment.
It is because you know, when we played a game with a game. We are even more happiness, that we're even more happiness than when you reach out of the headline, you can see or when you go ahead or when you go to your friendships.
We know that we are optimistic optimistic that we are humiliation that we are humans going to work on the street.
And the today's gone of these are available.
And finally, you know, the same.
You know, I love my song to be waiting to be attacked by the way.
So, just a little bit of a little bit like to help us see things in the perspective,
So, you know, you all know about Within Within the bottom of the ball in the world.
The second is to the second largest wife. Hi, with almost 8,000,000-day articles is the World Wark.
You know, millions of people use a million people use every month.
And they compared to it.
They build it.
They are confeside by a resource of the resource of knowledge.
Okay, so we have this four strength of the strengths that buy in a single thing.
Good by the hands are the individuals are the strengths and full of hope.
They are people who think there are people who are capable of the world.
And the only thing is that they think they are the capability to change the worldwide of the worldwide, but not the virtues but not the real world.
This is the problem that I try to solve it.
It's an economy.
And it turns out that it is the gene of itself. He studies how people investing in the way that people investing so much time and energy in the world.
And he says, "We're going to be margin, "We are married by what you do.
I mean, you know, it's a saving.
And he says, "You know, I'm not as I -- I am a game designer.
But he says, this really has a sense that this really has a sense of claim because the player can get more in the worldwide.
They can be.
They received the girl, and they feel better, and I feel worse worse. You see in your game.
So, he tells you now, he has a little bit like a sense of shape with the players to spend more time in the world in the real world.
Now, I also agree that this is the shame, for the moment.
But it's not in any case, it's an optimal situation.
We need to begin to do the world more like a game more like a game more like a game.
And so, I traveling my hands from something that happened in something that happened to 2,000-year-old.
These are the spot of ankly ankly created from the bottom of an hour.
You know, at the end of being controlled by extraordinarily controlled by the juggling of juggling.
And this is the first equivalent of the game.
And if you are born familiar with the work with the work of the work of the other side of the mistake of the house.
Which is the history of these.
Hi. She's gone.
You know, it was so much like this was a bunch of flaw in the Middle of the Middle East, he decided that he had to do something crazy.
People are born in the window. The people are going to work.
It was an extreme situation. They needed a solution. They needed an extreme.
So, the conference of Hi. Today, they have invented, they have invented the game, they invented the games of the window and the definition and definitely definitely definitable in the room.
You see, every day, one of them will eat.
And the next day, everyone is going to play.
And it's going to be so focused on the speech of speech, because the games are so cool, because the games are so sold and you learn how to stand you learn how to stand in a product.
And so the day of the today's game.
And the conference with Hi. Today's breakfast of the dung that 18-year-old lights survival.
Now, this is what I think is thrights, the way we use play.
Helfly around. We're going to play the games to fall of the sample of the suffer from the real world.
You can fly around. We're going to play the games to fly through the bottom of the girls of everything that is straightforward, everything is not satisfied in the road, all of our life and our lives, and our lives, our life and receiving what we need in the game, we need in front of what we need in the game.
But I don't have to go here.
This is very interesting.
BF: BF: Buildlife spreading by 18-year-old, after 18-year-old girlfrightened don't attention to it.
And so, the way they decided that they would play play.
They did. They have a whole bunch of gap.
They were playing a game of flood dancing, and the window, and win the window they got the chance to go in a hand.
They're going to leave you and LB: They are going to be.
And they will go to the cause of a new place in which to live in the living. It goes on to the board, just like so many of the people how to survive. She's going to survive with the roads that were disappearing the resources that were disappearing the resources that would be disappearing to the strength of the hand, and hope.
Now, this sounds like crazy.
But recently, you know, you look at the DNA shot show, they have shown you where they have shown you that confused by Imagine that they have the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA, they had the same DNA and the old side of the streams.
And this is what we look like the south of the southern of the name of HGee.
And the way they found out of the boundaries of a glass of a global road, which was about 20 years old, and what they could be explained about 20 years old, and what they could be explosion.
So, this crazy story could be true.
They could even be able to save his shouldn’t gone of the game.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing with the Western damage of the 19th of 1997.
The girl was the first game, it was the first game.
They were playing. They were playing. They have gone for 18-year-olds for 18-year-olds for 18-year-old.
I say that we are gone.
Now, they had half of the civilization that he walked up to the cause of it.
So, here I go to my 2,000-and-a-billion hours of play.
Have you guys are going to be able to succeeded by half of us to get a half of us to play a half of us to play.
Now, I know you ask you the question, "Look how can we solve the problem of how can we solve your life in the game.
We have this banker at the office of our Glacks in the P.C. and you can see on the today's option of how to try to talk about what we try to talk about how to try to relate to the future.
We don't want to try to predict what we want to talk about the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to look at this point, we are the best stage.
And then we want to stand besive people to translate this stage of the stage of this stage,
We want to look at this point, you know, we won the wisdom and then put people in the middle of the balls of those to get these windows.
I want to show you very short about three of the games that I did try to give you some people who are trying to off.
So, this is the Law of the Fridge of the GD.
I created this game.
This is a game.
Helfly of ownership is of okay, but we put it out there as a little girl, and you can think that it is the reality that you can think is real-life lives, and you don't have an own, and you don't have okay, when you haven't got okay. So when you look at this game. You look at the bottom of us in this game.
And then it turns out that you are going to be a real video in the real time that you look at exactly how much you can look at exactly how much you get your own, which is not disappearing the bone; it turns out the same. And so it's kind of how it is gone.
And you need to imagine. You have to imagine how you lived in your life if you all this would be true. And then you can see you get the ridge. And then you can put it in a blog of a bunch of filmmakers, and the pictures of the picture.
I tested this game.
And I followed up three years of my life.
And I can tell you that it's an experience.
Nobody wants to go to the chemistry of only life because it is good for the world, or because it has to be done.
But if you include it in one hand, you can see it on the wise, and they say, "You know, you see it without okay, you know, "You are without okay."
This is a story, and this is a great story, which is what to do with you get your boat.
So let's look at the challenge to see how you survival.
You can fall of the same.
So, for the future of the game that you can save the world, I decided to keep the world of the world I think about the issue than lack of your own, bigger than the lack of own.
I mean, this is what a game called SuperCount.
And the pregnant thing was that a super-computer. It was a computer.
Suppose the computer is called "Cloud" is called the Gaming of Excell.
I got the road, the people to come up with almost in an online online movies like in Jesus Bring.
You know how the filter of June of Jamary Christian Bring. His Bring. Helf. Helf. His sick, it shape.
You look at the astronomy of thesis of the strength of science.
But in our game.
Today, I had 80,000 people who have played this game.
They were invented by 500 solutions. Science of the credit that you can see if you can see if you go and see if you go and look at the bonds and search structure.
So, finally finally fine, the last show, the last slide of the shape of the mountains in three mark. This is a game. This is a game.
Think about it with the university of everywhere in the subject of all Africa, and they invite.
We have a lot. We have a year.
You know, I would like to invent with you all of you to share this game with you.
So, now I'm going to show you.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think it's going to happen.
We all have these amazing today's amazing topics, we have these games, we have these games that are a kind of version of what we could do with the steps of what we could do with a whole world.
You know, I think you will agree that you will agree with me that too.
We all have these super-powered strength of these amazing strength, producing strength, the ability of the strength, the ability of the strength of the strength of these social relationships, and this sentence, and this feeling of optimism and wanting and wisdom of optimism and you can see the same.
And I hope in the southern shock that we can see us play.
And it's my hope that you are going to join you and play with you and play.
When I think about the future, I think of the next decade, I know two things that we can create any future. And we can create any future. And we can put it in the picture, and we can play.
So, I said, "Look at the bottom of the games that change the world.
Thank you.
I am really interested in the except of the same.
Of course, the same way, the cloud of the flaw with the flaw a meal effect of the hands of the shock of the hands of the hand, because the person is what happens to you think that the person, just because the person is an effect, or something like a little girl, or something like -- or something like -- or something like -- or something like -- or something like ...
For the pain, for instance, if it's creding. For example, if it's creding.
Somebody fe. It becomes a real way that someone else in a way that someone in a perception.
So to look at this point, I want to start by showing you a little bit of showing you a little bit of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how this is a trick. This is a trick that you find out of the damage of magnitude in 197.
And I learned, I learned from Christians.
I'm going to show you and then I'm going to explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain.
So, here's what happens.
She's gone.
So I'm going to take you on the hands in the hand.
And I'm going to sick your hand.
And in order to make sure that there is nothing to do in your hand, or you don't look at my hands from my hand. I will fit up here.
To see that there is no circle on here.
So as long as you can look at the bottom of the street and you don't get any of my hands and nothing from my hand.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open up the hand, and I hope that if it all good, you know, if it all good, you know, my animal.
In fact, it's so good, you know, it's so good, I can fly that I can slow your hand.
Not the circle of it.
Take it.
Helfly of the girl, you learn that on the other side of the other side of the steps of the strength, because you can travel to the step, because you can traveling a lot of about the shock of the shock that if it's very simple if it's very simple.
And it turns out that many of the people here knock it.
Here's what happens.
She's gone.
And I tell you that I'm going to leave my hands with my hands to my hang my hands to my hang me that you don't get anything on the boy.
And it turns out that I'm going to keep in the juggling of the dance is actually the secret is actually the secret of this stuff.
At the time, my hands of my hands are moving in front of you and you don't see it and you don't see it, and you don't look at the bottom of the shock is going to go through a shock where it is by the kind of like this.
All right.
It is a child without a baby without a kid.
So, this is how it works.
And as I reached my bread, my fingertips, my finger fingertips.
And we can talk about what you can look like you in this heroe, why you don't see this in the heroe, why don't you see there are three flag in here, because there is a light-hand side, and the way processes and the way that processed information. You know, two, three, two, three, two, three.
But this is not everybody.
You can see the same. This is where it doesn't seem to be there, not through the magnitude of the bodies, but through a shock of my hand.
And then when you look at the bottom of the smoke.
I give my hands up to a part.
Take the same. You can do this friendship and you can make your friendships.
Now, what is connected with the effect of the same.
I read a quote study, with a year in which he opened my mind.
I am not the dock of the research. So this is what this is amazing.
It turns out that if you add your minister. You see a step.
But if you change the shape of the shape of the same.
Of course, no one of these pasts have no subject of these flaws. They are gone.
But the past.
DH: What does it leave me with my mother.
And yet it turns out that it doesn't seem to stop.
If you take the end of the road, I'm more effectively effectively effective than the camels.
One is the headline.
And by the way, this is a little bit of this stuff.
A phase of two times a day on the day is not as good as you -- not as good as you can. It's not as well.
But the idea is,
... Today, and two, and the boss of the conference.
And by the form of something to do with this.
And if you want the most effectively effectively effect. You have to go on the bottom of it.
DH: Helse? Of course, with something like this.
So this is an image so stronger for them, much more powerful than the past.
It's like this.
Helfly is that the phase phase is not as good as the white as the white as the white as the white as good as and it's not as good as and it's not as good as and it's not the same way.
And there is no way there is no quete.
You just go to the point of viewing us a network in our body and produce a little bit of our body and produce a stronger.
And I wanted to see if I can apply this idea of the idea of this idea at a trick.
And to take something that is obviously a trick, and I can make it too.
And we know from that studio.
This is a hurt of the bird of the seven.
And I'm going to stand bread.
That's my hand.
This is the same.
I'm going to cover the pieces of the step, and I'm going to fly with this picture.
If you are born with the same.
So you suggest that if you look at that if you look at the same. You can look at the next part of the next part of the next slightly in the next slightly in the next slightly I don't do the first part of the step.
You're going to look at it, you will look at the other side if you want.
So, this is, right here in this part of the bottom of my arm and I will make a little gose.
It seems to be fair.
And now I'm going to go through the skin on the bottom of the same, and you go on the other hand.
Now, we're about the same point as we are about the same point in the same.
That's what I was like this.
But now you can't count my fingertips, like this.
Well, you know, okay. You know, you look at it.
Yes, of course,
You know, I know what people think about when I see this.
She's going, "Look, you know, it's not so proud to reach out that you can fall of us on the other side of us on a couple of new minutes. Of course, you take a few minutes. Take a little bit.
What does it look like? Yes.
Yes, you know. And those in the back. And you will say, "Look at this point. OK.
Let me show you better.
This is really the skin.
This is my career.
You know, I ask the same. If you are doing. If you look at the bread, you know, you look at the other hand, you don't look at it.
Think about it in the back, or those who want to look at the video of the video of the video of the video, "Look at this point, it looks pretty curious stuff, it looks pretty curious stuff, but if you have a gone in there -- if you had a gone in there and there would be a gun, if you would be shooting up there, and you look at the damn and some of your hands and some of the hand.
Your daughter.
You are normally normal, I would take the same.
And I would look at the bottom of the hands of the hand, and you don't have any show you that I haven't got no random.
But I think that in this context and the idea of taking a little girl, and this is what I'm going to be able to leave it in there, I'm going to leave it out there, and I'm going to leave it on the stage.
We can see some of the damage of these days.
You know, I hope that you expect the snake. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So, I met a bunch of dancing in my life.
I loved only by the way.
The first thing was more like a little bit more like a bird business.
It was a beautiful fish.
What's fish.
And even better, it was grown up to a farmer, the flaw, the other standard.
So you can just be. You can see when you come up with it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty of the beauty on the street.
You see, in a day, the sample of the girl, and she asked me if she asked me if I would talk about a little bit about a lot.
"Look at the point of vie," I said.
This is a company.
How do we look at the bottom of the fish on the men's men's men.
For the last 50 years, I have the peak of the bottom of the bottom of the oceans and the oceans as I deforest.
It's hard to fall of the approach to the destruction.
Next hundred percent of the fish of the sample that I loved the sea that I loved to the stage of the board, you know, the fish. Hello, fishing down the road, fishing the bread.
That's where they have gone that they disappeared.
So as well as the strength of the board.
There are a lot of this.
I mean, my fish fish. His fishing in the same.
A lot of fall of the way.
Take has a little bit of the conversation of the conversation.
That means that you need 15-and-and-and-blood fish.
It's not very sustainable.
And they also don't have the guess of these.
So okay, in the end, it was a company that I try to do it.
I wanted to be.
And the day of the day, I was born with the point of view, I have calling the strength of the audience in the company.
Helse's name. We call it D.
Yeah, I mean, I said, "Look at least to put things on the point, you are Christians, because you are Christian. You know, because you are like this. You are so far as far as far as the policy.
"Look at the bottom of the bottom of it. We are so far as far as far as far as far as far as the strength of the bodies of our bodies are gone.
And then he adds him, "Look, we are actually a world of new world.
RB: You know, this is the shot of the dancing is bad?
"Look at the bottom of the pieces on the stage.
Take it up to a bunch of those.
"Take 1. She's five to another five to one of you who are use.
"Helsewhere. Helf. She's gone.
"Come on. Helloa," I was like, "Look, I finish," I finally find. I find.
And in that night, I was born, I was trick, I was traveled in my hand, and thinking: What nuts is a protest is a protest is a protein with you?
So the second day before the event of the events, I call it D.
I said, "Yeah, let me show me some of the extension of the protest of protein. He told me that you don't know. He said nobody knows that you don't know.
Well, I talked to the phone with a few people in the same.
Next one could not be able to give me an answer.
In the end, I talked to the biologist.
Helse's name. We call it D.
"Don't got," I said, "Look, you know, I love some of the protest of the protest of protest of protest here.
I said, "Look at the bottom of the puppphass?"
He said, "Look at the bottom of the step, the steps of the bottom of the bottom of the steps and processing and processed it in the hands and process.
And I said, "Look at the bottom of the bottom of your hand, you know, it's a little bit of you?"
You look at the point of view, you know, you understand the step, you know, about two percent.
"You know, it's about 30 percent of the bottom of 30 percent.
"Yeah, what it is sustainable to be. You can see in the board.
It was a shock of the damage on the line. And he said, "Look, and he said, "Look, I'm just too many of you in the world."
RB: You know, my dung for this fish for this fish.
Nothing because I would be a little bit like a glass of the next to the virtue.
In fact, they are.
Next, I was feeling like this.
And the second fish. It's another kind of love, it's another kind of love.
It's the kind of not, the kind of the kind of the way that you know how you know how much you love it.
You know, I was showing her hands up to a restaurant in the bottom of the Spain.
A friend of the girl's friendshifted by the hands of a lot of time.
It was kind of the kind of showing us the meeting.
He came to the mother's wildlife in the blue, light, lighten, almost scale.
She's gone.
I mean, I have two hours.
She's gone.
While can do it as a fish to have a seat to be able to get the good news?
I don't hate it, but this guy.
Helse's name. We call it Make Mik.
In fact, the name is my name is Mount.
And it's not, he's not finishing the fish of the fish and he's not gone.
You know, a little bit of the way you and I understand this.
He is a bike.
It's a fish.
It's at the bottom of the same.
The 19th of the 19th of the 1970s, my hands was in the hand.
They are growing up. They were sitting in the area in the area that was actually a little bit.
They fit by the way. They created by the way.
And they built this series of the channels of channels, and they get rid of the water, and they go out in the rights, back in the rights.
But they couldn't make it work.
And the screen of the girl was a disappoint.
He killed 9/11, 1,000 percent of the bird of the birds that for this place that place for this place, a lot of birds.
And so in the 1980s a Spanish.
What did they do?
They've got the same.
They have coming.
Instead of boring on the bottom of the bottom of the water, they used the frogs of the fish.
They've got the same.
They created a fish. Helf. Helf. She's 1.
From my daughter is incredible.
I mean, you don't have seen something like this.
Take step. She's gone.
I was there not a lot of Middle East.
He is a great kind of same.
All right, okay? And this is what you call us here before we go out there before.
This is what it looks like a window with the claim of the needs.
So now you can see the needle needs.
And this is where he sees a guy in the group that you reminds that reminds them of the gift.
And I learned that Mr. Science of the dancing of the shock of the dancing of the Next of Middle East.
I mean, I wondered how to become an experiencing experiment.
He said, "You know."
I am an expert in the relationship."
And then they launched up in a lot of discussions about the birds of the bird of the board, and you see the street and the strength of this planet.
And I don't understand me.
It was great.
And I was gone.
So I wondered. I said, "Look at the bottl, "High List."
He showed up to the algorithm.
"Your daughter, philosophical stage.
But what you eat the bottom of your fish.
Which is the river of the conversation. Helsewh?"
Well, he started to tell me that this is a system like this is a system of rich system, the fish. You see what he would be handed by the hands that would be hand.
Sciden. It's like this plan, and the plane of this.
It's like this.
It's not necessarily required.
You know, you ever heard about it.
More than I was in that day, I was a card with this properties with this properties with my hand, and I said, "Look for a place that looks like like this, and I said, "Look at the bottom of any other far" -- and I was like, "Look what I was wander?"
At that point, it was like like Christian dancing of a film will be certainly changed.
And I gave my daughter, and I saw the most amazing.
"You know, this is successful." I love it.
"Look at the bottom of the steps of their room.
And it's gone.
She's gone.
I said, "You know, I guess my son, but they don't get the same.
"Yes.
"Come on. With 20 produced 20 produced by the bottom of our fish and of our fish and of our fish.
Well, the last year, this is the properties of 60,000 footprints on her houses on it, more than 2,000-year-old.
Today, he became the biggest and one of the most important and one of the most important thing.
And I said, "Look at the point, you know, a population.
He climbing his hand. Helse's head.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the fish.
This is an expect.
Helfly of the bottom of the bottom of the same.
Please thinking. Helf. She's gone.
So how to fly is the sample is the best system, the more is the better system.
All right, okay, to require this.
A farming that doesn't hurt their houses of the animals, and a farms, and a farm that they eat the same time.
A fish. His fishing my bos, but a sand.
Of course, by the way, those birds, those birds, those birds of the flowing flow. It should even be there.
They look at the front of you in a 1,000-square kilometers in the street, where the window condition, where conditions are better to build their hands to build the step.
In every morning of the road, she fly 2,000-kilomeach.
And every evening, they fly around, they fly 2,000-kilometer.
They are doing this because I'm able to watch the state.
It's not a joke.
I was imagining something like the mark of this.
I said, "Look at the point, they fly through 2,000 kilometers of 1,000-kilometer jaw, and then they fly in the street, and then they fly 2,000-kilometer?
And they do this for the kidn't.
And she looked at me as I looked at me as a quote reading in a song of songs of songs.
He said, "Yes. No.
I did not mentioned the skin. Helfish.
I don't like this.
It's got that gone.
When you find out of the same, I give you a little bit of every time.
Everybody, and when I guessed up at that restaurant at that restaurants in the southern Spain, you don't have a bunch of glasses.
It takes a little bit of a joke.
So I mentioned this girlfrightened that you and smile.
He said, "Look at the bottom of the claim of it.
It's the last slide of the defense in the way.
It was evolved to above my wife.
And then he adds up to him, "Look, our water has no expensive.
All right.
One of the fish that they eat her husband the successful of successful animals.
And then I understood that when he said, a farm that doesn't haven't haven't got the shape of the board, he was a lot of this stuff, because the water, the water, the water, the water that water, the waterfrozen rights.
It's a laughing with he brings with all the things that you laughing with you on the other hands that you in the damage of these days, and the chemical strength of the bonds of the pest.
And when they do their road through the system, and you leave it with the step, the water is more curious than at the end.
It's like this.
So, not only a farmer. I don't just hurt their gap.
Because when the water goes on to the bottom of the same, she reaches up to Of this year.
A paint showing you in the ocean, you know.
You can tell you that this is a network.
What we need now is a conference that radically radically new agricultural agriculture, one in which it really has gone.
But for a bunch of people is a little bit like this is a little bit too radically radically.
We are gone.
We are sick. We are gone.
We love the strength of the fish.
We love the little bit of the fish of the farmer of dying.
We're talking about food. We're talking about.
We are handed by the way.
And when you get sick. You know, these are the things that will make sure the future. You know, they're going to the bread, someone somebody's going to stand says, "Look and he says, "Look and you love and saying, "Look at the bottom, and I love with the bottom of the flowing of the glasses that are going to be. You look at the bottom of the like?
How are you going to feed the world?"
Can I guess the girl?
I don't like that question.
Next because you already haven't got a lot more quick than you need for the world.
A billion people are going to fly of people will be flowing today.
And one billion -- this is more than anybody's more than anyone who -- because of the mark of the same.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined this question, because it drives our hands in the last 50 years.
His bad. Helf. Helf. His banding with birds with the board, they treat the bottom of the steps of the steps with the steps of the bonds of the windows, you put it on the ground, and all of the slightly gone on the ground, and the whole thing can be like if you look at the shape of the shape of the slight?"
This was the reason.
It was justice.
It was the plan.
I should tell you the name of the name, a business of dancing in the high school.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
Right? And the point of our fish.
You want to go away.
Let's go to the point of the question: How are we going to hurt ourselves: How are we going to fall of us.
Or more good, how can we create condition conditions that allows you to be.
In order to do that, not look at the path of the business of dancing dancing in the future.
It's very old, and it's dangerous.
I mean, it's a lot of chapter a lot of capital, chemistry and the car, and you don't have any good hand.
Instead of that, let's look at the path of the screen.
This is the bottom of billions of years of experience.
Look at the point of view, you know, the girl, farming in my hands like my song that are not the light that I'm not the light-hands that are not the light-hands that restorative spreading in the hands that restorate instead of walkingdom, and you look at the extensive, the extensible place to the strengthrips. You can look at the other hand.
And if I want to be a really bad thing. They are the joint of them are better.
You know, I guess my career with this, because if this is the future, because if this is the future of her grandfather will be dollar here.
Thank you.
I grew up with a bunch of Spain.
At the high school. I was going to go with the dung of the girl in my school, and one dark her, and one dark and one day.
And I was always about. And I was always a chart of a dancing book, which is a little bit of the girl, what you have.
And -- you know, you know -- that curiously.
I was a truth of dying.
But it was all connected with my work to understand the world; to understand the world.
And my bird for science. I mean, this is the same.
Jeacht. His fishing Christmas speech wisdom in the southern shock with our amazing fingertips of our amazing stunk that shows us with the amazing stunk that shot us and places in a fantastic world that we could not be able to imagine.
So, that's what it looks like.
And I was an artist.
I was a drawing drawing. I was pain.
And I discovered that, because there is no way.
You know, you all know, you have to be showing you how kids need to read.
And so, I mean, my answer to all of this was to draw up with my hands and pain, to pain.
I was always the print of the math of the math of the faith.
This is what happens, because this creative creativity, I had to find their gap.
And this is an interesting thing that is what it looks like.
I couldn't really go in a real world. I could truly in the world.
This dream of the same.
But that was a world where I really go, I really walking around here, on the Earth, and this was the kind of rich and this is the same way that I was like anything else.
So, I decided I was going to become a strength of the bottom of 15.
And the only thing with this problem with this is that I was living in a small window. I was living in Canada, at 600-year-olds on the street.
But I did not leave this really with this idea.
I mean, I was gone. I love with my father to my father until I find my father until he finally finally he was finished by the hand, a clockers in Buddhhhhhhurt in the Bridgs. It was just next to the glasses.
And I even became the same.
And I haven't seen the ocean, a truth ocean, for two years ago when we moved in California.
From the bottom of the bottom of 40 years, I spend about 3,000 years ago, I spent about 3,000-hours and 500 hours of those hours and 500 hours of those hours were in the subject.
And I learned, I learned, the deep, the deep, and even the ocean, and the oceans are so deeply the oceans are so please. You are so pleasant that we can imagine what we can imagine.
Imagine nature's nature is so lack of the sample of speech with our hands with our hands with our hands with our hand.
I am completely uplied by what I see when I do these speech snake.
And I love the story of love with the oceans with the ocean, and it is the same strong, and it is the same way as it was daming.
But when I picked up a step, like adult Christians, that was what it was like this.
And this is the best way to be the best way to get this thing that I need to tell storik with the storiky of building with it.
And you know, in the kids' bodies. I draw up my bad, and so forth.
So I think of the filter of the films was the way to put the pictures and the stories.
And of course, of course, the storik that I chose to tell them were stories that I pick up the storiky of these days, you know, "Lookkk" and "Look at this point: "Look," and "Look at this point," and "Look glass" and "Look glass" and "Look glass."
And you know, "Look at the bottom of the bound," I see my love lot.
Common the ball of these two steps.
And it turns out that something like "Look at this point of "Christian." And that is what you want to be sold in this narrative of a slightly creative. And this is the creation of this daughter, and this is the creation of the water, and that's what I was shocked up to the bottom of the stage, which is generated by the strengthose.
And that led to the first character that came up with a film.
And even though the film didn't do the money, I should tell you that you want. He won her hand.
You know, it's the legs of the end.
They seem like this.
And so, that's what it made me get really exciting me to become very excited.
And I thought, "Look, it's like, "Look, this is something that has to be something that has to be shopped in the art.
Think about it in "C" -- you know, "Look at 1,000," which was my next to my movie, I took this much more and more on.
Think of it with Imagine with I.D., I created on the individual meter, I created on the individual meeting in that film, and in that film, and this is going to work in that film, and this is going to work.
And it works like this. And we created by the mostly mad.
And I had the same result with the audience.
I did something more money on this way.
So this is where I lived with a link between these two experiences between these two experiences.
In the conference of the bond, I put the basis of a company with the State with State with Stand.
And the idea behind the girl was that we're going to fly over the processes of the analogy of the analoging of the pictures of the picture, and this is how far and so far beyond the digital product.
And I actually did that, what gives us here: it an advance.
But I was in half-and-a-half-and-"'" borders about 9/11, the design part of the creation of design and characters and charged in and characters, because the company that company.
And I wrote this piece of girlfrightening called "Chridddd" that he had the range of shoppk that he had a little bit of what you see on the side effects of the vision, and the visual effects of the visual effects, and the visual effects, and more with the character with the shape of the shape of the shape of the talk,
And the character of my main to be completely generated by the Christians.
And the world was going to be everybody.
But the planet.
And the people at the bottom of my friendly said that we will not do this for a long time.
So, I put the idea on the street and I did another film and made another film about a boat.
You know, I went and I went and present it to the study of the dancing like "Chrid" and June and June and June and Jesse."
And I was going to be a story of the notion of the profound stories.
In the secret of what I wanted to do. I was going to do was snake.
And that's why I did the film.
This is true. All right. Well, the studies don't know.
But I was convinced. I said, "Look. We're going to be able to be.
We're going to be using this at the beginning of the beginning of the movie.
You see, it was very important to be an extension of being an extension of the seat for the market."
And I was convincing to fund the dancing on a stage.
It sounds like crazy.
Because we really created a reality in which I mean, in the next six months later, you see me in a subject me in a subject.
Now, this fascinating me.
And it takes a lot of preparation of the dancing, we had to build the road, and all sorts of things like this, and all kinds of things like this, and all sorts of this kind of slightly in this room of the same, this snake, this slide, and it was like like this.
You know what, it was everything that it was strength, and it turns out, and what you look like.
We're looking at this point in the headach, you get to the bottom of the next to this environment in this environment. And this is the screen and the window and the steps of being safety of being saving if you can't come back, you can go back if you can't come back.
And I thought, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at this point. Part I live in a robot.
This is really cool."
And so I was really caught by the way.
Of course, the point of the circle of the same.
It was everybody. It was part.
And it was an experience. And it was a Hi.
Because, you know, I could take my imagine. I can imagine.
Whereas I was doing some of the expensively expensive. I mean, I have seen.
So, I was completely sick, I was totally stepped by this and I had to have more to more than I had to have to be able to more of it.
And so I took a decision-making.
After the successful of Tex.
And so I started pleasant to pleasant these expeditions.
And we got to go to be. We go to the same.
And we were going to go back to the meeting of the shot of the Christians.
I took the small robots that you create a little bit of the boy that we have.
And the idea was looking at the same time.
Next. Nobody looked like this.
So, you know, you know, you look at the bottom of the TV.
And I'm controlling a little bit of a little bit of the robot.
When I say, "You know, you are controlling him, my mind is in that vehicles.
I felt like I was a part.
And it was the worst of the list of the commercial already I have a little bit of the boy that I had, because you know, I was going to be there, because you know. I was going to be there, before you get there, before the right-hand vehicles that will be there, because I was going to be there, because I was raising my hands when I was raising my stage. Because I was paying on the stage.
And the stage, it was built. It was built as a network.
This was an experience.
And it made me look at this point of real talk, the talk, which you can have with these talks that you can have with these robotics with these robotics, when you consistent strength in in a vehicle in a vehicle in a vehicle in this other form of existence.
It was born in the truth is a professor.
And maybe a short look at what you might happen on what you might happen over a few decades, as we can begin to see with the cycle of the cycle of the cycle of the shocks or other hands in a lot of these kinds of patterns that I can imagine.
So this is what I do is doing, when these expedition and beginning to show you there, you know, I really discovered there, like these days, I discovered that jammed up there, like these steps on the bottom of the bottom of the oceans, where I discovered these animals, where I discovered these animals, I discovered animals.
They are essentially the same.
You know, they live in an average of the same. His chemical. It doesn't survive in a basket system, you see in a basket system, like us.
So you can see the animals that are living by the bottom of the bottom of the water with temperature.
You are thinking. You know, you can't survive.
At the same time, I was really interested in the same time of the science of speech, again, the influence of the science, again, influencing science. This is a little bit of the damage that I experienced in my kid.
And I went to the step. It involved in the community. You know, the whole of the gload of the space, very involved with NDD. H: Skkkkkkkets. Scientist strength of the congestion of the congestion of the dancing on the strength of the dancing of the dancing of the duty of the way.
And that was fascinating.
But what I was going to do is do is to bring it up to the same.
And that's what it takes to do for them to have the action of them to get their own biologists, scientists, scientists who were interested in this planet, who were interested in these environments, which were interested in these environments, and you take these environments, and you know, it's deep, and you can see it on the shock and see it on the shock and go and look like; he's going to look like.
So this is what you do is doing, and you see when the films of the girls, but in fact, the study, but in fact, I was looking at the science.
So I ended up the circle between being the same.
I learned a lot about a lot about the science. But I also learned a lot about a lot of about art.
Now, you would think that you have to be.
I don't know how I really learned about the art.
Because you have gotten a moment of data. What do I say, "What do I do I here?"
Why do I do this? What do you do?
We do not make money with these snake.
It was like this.
You know, I think that I was walking between "Christians. She's walk." And I was like, "Everybody." And he said, "Look and I was doing my hand" and that I was doing my own stunk with the glass of the dung on the bottom of the bread.
I made all of these films, I did all these documents,
Next. Today's fair, without the glasses of dying. What do you do?
You do it for the work in the synthesizing -- and the ocean is the most challenge is the most challenging of the way that there are some of the things that exist, and for emotion and for the shipping and for the shapes that shaping a little group of people who are shaping a little bit of a shape of glasses.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 1,000,000-day talks about 1,000-year-old daughter.
Something like [unclear] [[[[[unclear] [1] [1.] Think about three months of the window.
And in this connection -- you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have for them and what they have to do for you’re doing for youth, that you haven't explain you can explain then.
When you go back to the bread, you know, I mean, you don't have to do this, and you don't have to do this, and I have to do this, and you look at the optic, and you look at the bottom, and this is implicated, and the other hand, and the other things that was implicated, and the other things that was engaged, and you can't look at the same point, you can explain the other hand, and you can explain the way you can explain the ge.
It looks like a connection to the bread, you create a connection of respect.
So, when I went back to the next movie, my film, which was "Christian," I was like, "Look, I tried to go away.
And he really changed the girl.
So here's what I'm going to do with a little bit of a team with a little bit of speech, on the other hand.
Excell.
I mean, you know, it's about the cause of the challenges of the challenge.
And I became a family, on the park of a fifth of a life of four years and a half-year-old.
And that changed all my way to do the movies.
So these people have commandments on the board.
For me, it was a fundamental way to do business, the process of doing business.
So, what can we look like this?
You know, what are the same, what are the less?
Well, I think that the first is the bottom of it.
It's the most powerful thing that I have.
Imagine is a force that you can eat which is a really cool.
And I break the fish of the damn is more important than everyone in the world.
Take the creatures of the filter of the films come to me and saying, "Look at me and he says, "Yes.
And I say, "You know, I'm not limited to you.
Of course, people will do this for you'd do this for you.
And you go to the point of today."
Next. She's gone.
But Imagine the screen has to be an opathlete to the art, because it's a little bit of exploration, because it is a little bit like a dying.
And it's not the important thing to do is really important to try and innovate not done without rising innovation.
You have to be willing to stand you have to stand you get those risk.
So, this is the dung that you can lose you -- which is that in any of you have. She's a dung of Egypk. This is a fair, but Africa's option. Thank you.
You know, I would leave you with a single meaningful ideas. And that's what I think about the whole amount of data, which is the whole amount of data that we see is bigger than the summer, and instead of thinkings, and instead of thinking. And instead of thinking about what we can see in the surfaction with the way that we can use to think about the way that we can use the shape of the way that we can use the pattern.
And now we look at a graphic of the dead of the mortality of the way of organizing with the step.
It's about the bottom of the girl that I use here is an experiment, which is the name of P.C. bread, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with him, and what I can do with your morning, and the cause.
I see the average of the environmental structure. It takes a different structure.
And this is where in the middle, in the middle, people are in the middle, people are in the period of their active, and here because they become very fragile.
We are sick, and we have a shot back and throw it back, and we see the data, we see the dead, we see the same, you see the circle and cancers and cancers and cancer.
If we continue to stand the filter of the peak of the bottom of 40 or less you can see 40 or less you can see the accident, you see that the accidents are actually the most flag that they are actually going to fit up with the other people.
And more than the case for men, it's particularly the case.
You can see the boss; you see that this kind of visualizing as this kind of the data, it's like you can see in a bunch of information.
And if we can do this with the simple data of what we do with the same with the content with the content.
This is where we have cooken.
They're all here. I'm all on the Internet.
You can go to the point of the way that you go home.
With thanks to the strength, you can look at some of the time.
And then that's what you do.
You can finish you go out to a certain subject.
I look at that -- I see the boundaries that came in this field of gap.
I am a big flag of the Arg.
If I just want to look at them, you can look through the mindship. You can see what they have to see what they have to see about what they have to do about what they have to do in the five?"
I come back to the bread, and open it.
You can see it on the Greek.
And you understand that when you don't see that when you navigate with the dung of information. You know, when you specifically in the way that specifically, when you specifically, you go away, and you go back and for, you know, you don't look at the sky.
Helf. You know, a little bit different.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle, and we think that change in the way that you can be used to use.
I want to go a little bit beyond this idea that is a little bit of a song.
I took every page of Within New York City and I reach, and I reached it up to a show.
RB: You know, you look at the bottom is just a quarter of description and a little bit of the shock that indicate that show.
And I just show you the first 500 of the population of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom there.
But even in these days, you know, we can make a lot of things.
The average of the environment. We see who are subject of the most populations of the world's most popular list of Wighter.
Now I'm going to sell the expected.
Now I guess that I can see cats, I can see the catch in Within Within Within the 19th that cooking the best, which is the most flag of the best, and this is reaching and this kind of a Christianity.
And this is important because it wasn't a thing that it was not consistent in any extension of Within Within the hand.
You can see what you can do with this stuff, just if you do a step, and you look at it and you look at all the simultaneously.
Look at the point of all these strength of these strength particles, and then I can explain it more attack, and then you see the steps of the steps of the shot of the Tex. Human -- and you can bring it up with all of the same.
And I look at these people see that most of the government.
So how many of them will come from the science.
Something like this, and a little bit of a little bit.
This is my head.
And this comes from the music.
And pretty interestingly interestingly, Betk is also a dress of the presence of TED.
And so we go to look at the window of the previously, the TED Fellow TED.
You see, you know, I don't know.
And I want to show you a thing that can take you through the surprise.
So I'm going to show you the New York Tes.
Helsewhere, you know, our hands -- our applied -- I don't want to call it frogs, because it's not really a broken broken. But you can see it's not a bunch of glass -- and you can see it -- and we use it -- and we use it -- and we use it to the glass every page.
And I can do a step, and I would go back to my best. And I can go back to a point of view.
Why is it importantly, because it is only access to the bottom of the weight of the web -- I can see my entire history, I can see my entire history in the same way.
And I can just explain it to him.
This is actually the situation of this is where we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today earlier.
And if I want to do a step, and I can look at all the way I can look at my strength history.
This is what I was looking at Better here for Like Like Like Day.
And here I can pick up a page and get to the bottom of it.
It's a meter. It's a lot.
Now, in our world, we think that the data is a blame.
We are pleasant to be. We fit of the same.
We're looking at the point of viewing us in the data.
I mean, if we were going to go back, what is all the way to come back, and I go back, and I go back and forth, and so instead of taking a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paper, we used to go from the next to many other things, and we're going to go from many more at the same point, and to find some kind of the kind of thing that otherwis?
If we do that, instead of doing this, instead of being caught in the head of the data, we could actually extract the data.
And instead of having only one relationship with the first steps with the data, we could even extract with your knowledge.
And if you extract the knowledge.
See this, thank you.
Everybody, the world is talking about happiness on the other day today.
I have a little bit of the name of one to the name of how many books they have the word "finger" in the headlink in the headlines in the last five years and reached in the last five years and reached with a 4-year-old.
There is a huge bunch of damn dance for happiness of the gap.
It takes a lot of strength of it.
All of the world would like to make people more happy.
You see, in the bottom of the flaw of the names of the girls in this field in this field, there is a few step, there are some cognitive storikle that stock us to make a climbing image.
I mean, my point of viewing you today is going to be doing the reference.
There are valuable to use that people who are thinking about the people who think about their own happiness as and researchers that study and research.
The first one of these steps of these steps is reaching in the reticket of the flaw the complexity of the complexity of happiness.
It turns out that it looks like "bone" "Look, it's not a word "walk" is not a use of the word because we use it too many different things.
And it turns out that there is a sense that there is a sense that we can reach it that we can reach it to the strength of this. We need to be able to reach this notion of the damage. We're going to have in this notion and to adoption and adoption of a slightly expensive.
The second headaches is a confused by the way.
There are two concept. It's very different, you know, the bunch of those.
And the third conference of the girl.
And this is a headline.
You know, just like this.
So I would like to start with the examples of a person who during a person who during the question, and the answer of the question, and he says, "Look at the end of a slightly my stories.
And he was like, he listening to you with a little bit of the girl, and the muscle of the girl, and he was absolutely beautiful.
But at the bottom of the wife.
In fact, it's not a little bit about six experience.
Take the damage experience.
Take it was about 20 minutes of the beautiful muscle of music.
But they were gone.
Hello. It was bonding to him.
BF: Helloak here is that you probably going to see us and the other side of us and the other hand.
There is a village at the point in the remains that remains in the presence of the talk, and he lies the shot shot of the show, you can see the past, but in the same.
It's synthesis of the shot of the shock of the shock of the girl.
RB: You know, when the doctor, you know, "Look at the end of the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom?"
On the other hand, there is the other side of the bonds, and it's the member of the member of them is the way that you have.
Is it the book. It's the girl, and you can see the Day of Day, when you ask the step, "Look at this point, you know, "Look at the bottom of the last slight?"
or "Look at the bottom of the same.
These are two of them are very different stations.
She's gone.
It starts with the answer with the basic response of the member of our member of ourselves.
We don't tell you the stories. You just know when we tell the stories.
Our daughter says our storiky is the storiky of the stories, what you do with this stuff, which is what you do.
RB: You know, I'm going to start with an example.
There is an old study of patients about the patients about the patients that go through a lot.
It doesn't look like in the detail. It's not pain.
You can go to the strength of the windows of the window and describes the pain, and you see the pain.
We have two patients and relationships.
And the question: "Look at this?" And he said, "What?"
It's a very simple question.
She's gone.
She's gone.
But here's another question.
And here we have a same.
Helf.
Next. She's not one of the relationship is not the member of the girl, or the girl, you know, but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them -- but one of them is about the other hands than the other.
And the most unexpected.
It's a little bit of needs.
Where do you know?
I mean, I wondered how these people after the collection of these people at the bottom of the girl, much later, the dung of the box was produced by the hand.
In their member of their memory, it was a lot more expensive.
It's a conflict is the direction of the same.
From the point of view, you know, this experiment, this is claiming experiment, it's claim that the patient of the same.
And what we could do with the patient -- and we actually did an experiment, and we actually did the clinical trial, which is going to work on the front of you have to talk about the mountains of the damage of the shock step, the kidn’t waiting for a bunch of glowing away.
This is going to make it on the patient to suffering, but a little bit less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes. And if we do the strength.
What is it definitely definity?
And this is true for the storik of the storigin which we are snakes that we are going to stand stories.
What is the definition of a story is changing.
She's gone.
In this case, I was finished by the way.
She's gone.
Is it a little bit of successful lies of life's living, and you come up with these days, and you know, what happens with these day?
And the answer is very simple.
They are losing on the board.
She's gone.
It means that in a life we have about 600 million of these days.
You know, in a month, we have about 600.
You know, I mean, you don't leave anybody.
She's all the way that I are completely ignored by dancing is completely ignored.
And yeast and somebody's going to be sick, that you should be. You see that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, that what happens in these days, and our lives.
It's the resource that we have to finish that we have, during the existence of our planet.
And the way that you have to be showing you some of the other hand, but this is not the story that this is the story that this is the story that there is a bird.
So we have synthesize the member of them and synthesis of the cliff, which are distinct.
It was the biggest difference between them is the way of them is the way that is processing in the time.
From the point of view, you know, this is the same, if you go out in the vaccine and the second week and the second week and the next week is the same way as the receiver of two weeks of these days, it was like a couple of weeks more than vacance.
For the other side of the girl, the things that doesn't work.
For some of the member of the girl, a vacuum.
It was the sample of it. It was changing.
Think of a little bit. The time is becoming variety of the glasses that distinguishing that distinguishing your membership.
Your daughter has an impact on the stories.
She's gone.
It's actually the one who decide that you decide that if you put it on the bottom of the board, for example, two cold, for instance, the second colony of the other hands with two keeps and decisions and decide what you do and decide what you do like to be able to put it on the road, the one will be a little bit, and it will be a little bit of dress,
She's gone.
We don't pick up in fact, between the experience, but the other side of it.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future, we don't think about the future.
We think about the future as we think about some of our ancient memories.
And essentially, you can think of this stuff, you can think of this stuff, as you can see a glass of the girl, and you can look at the member of the girl, and you can look at the bottom of the way that you can look at the rights, and you can see the experiences of the experiments that you don't nearly needs.
We have the sensation that when we go on the ground. We go in the vaccine and this is really happening very often, and this is walking in the vaccine -- in a very large measured, in a very large measure, in a very large measure of the slightly measured.
And this is kind of hard to justified me.
I mean, how much we consume our consumption is we consume ourselves?
This is one of the things that I explain the dominance of the girl.
And when I think about this stuff, I think about a vaccine that I spend on the board.
And I probably used to be seen.
RB: You know, I would be opening up the same.
So we have to do that, on a part. She's three weeks and on the other hand, and a half of the damage and half.
You know, there is a little bit of a talk.
You may be able to be a little bit of a lot.
Why do we agree that a lot of importance to the member of the shadow with the shadow?
So this is what I would like to think about a sense of thinking.
Image. You can see that at the next steps your vaccine with you know.
You know, you look at the same points of the same way.
And if you pick it up to another vacation, there is a conflict, there is a conflict.
And if you take the member of your mind as the crites as a critical thing.
Why do we choose the girls you that you choose the choice?
It's a problem where we confronted with a choice with a choice.
She's gone.
There are actually two concepts of your happiness that we can apply your happiness.
So you can ask the question: How do you get your happiness is synthese."
And, on the other hand, you look at the happiness of your happiness in my life.
And they're all happy.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by the way, we're now in the ways, we're now as to make a pretty good consistent of the girl about happiness.
Instead of change, happiness in the strength of this member of the living, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy.
RB: You know about how the satellite dge of dying. It is this person when you think about this person when you think about it.
It's a very different nothing.
It doesn't fit doesn't distinct distinction between these notion between these notes of these days, it's going to come.
DH: Helfly between your happiness between the hands of the gap.
By thinking. Helf. She's doing a song of 1,000-year-old girl. His in the world.
And they were done.
So over the last few years we started to learn some things about the two types of happiness.
And I think that lose the main that I have learning, which is the fact that I'm standing on the other hand.
You can see the steps of the village of dancing are some of their life, and this is actually not a lot of things about how they are in their life, and you are in their lives, and they are in their life.
Take it to give you an example of cockkroache, cookkken.
OK. You know, you look at something about the same.
DH: Hello. It tells you that anybody tells you that someone else's life.
So that's what you do.
You can see something that we are controlled by something that control.
She's gone.
You look at the same point, you know, this is the same.
There are some other hands up to the other hand, you know, these are dominance.
You look at if you want to look at the same. You see the dot of the two synthesis, you get to don't.
BF: Helloaded by what I said.
It's a not.
Now, very quickly, another reason that we can't queen in which we can't queen in the simplicity of the happiness is that we don't talk about happiness is that we don't talk about the same things that you don't look at the same point, and when we live in the hand.
So you know, if you put a little bit of the question. The question, you know, I'm the people in California of happiness are in California's right not.
You see, you know, you look at this point, you have to think that people have to be happier in California's life.
And what happens is the fact that when you think about the shipping of California in California, you think of the 19th between the California between California and the other hands of California and other places like this.
But it turns out that in fact is not very important to the strength of the experiment, and it's not very important for the other hands and it's not really important for the reflection of the reflection that decide how happiness that decide how happy.
You know, because of the face, because of the facts of the reflection of the flaw is at the bottom of some people could get --
And it's quite interesting to watch what we're going to come up with people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California in California.
So this is what their experiments are going to be happier.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen.
You see, when they look at the bottom of this stuff, you think about this stuff, and you will remind you how you can look at the same time.
It's very difficult to fit very difficult to think about the grandfather of the grandmother, and I hope that you see in the hand, and I off.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much.
A couple of weeks ago, the girl, when I talked at the speech, when you talked about the fact that you get a little girl, you get the interesting result of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite.
You think that you can share as you can share with you with your shape that you have a couple of minutes?
Yes.
I think the most interesting results. I think of the ball of the way we haven't got the same number that we haven't wait that we haven't expected.
And what we found was about the sample of the happiness of this experiment.
We look at how we looked at how variety of how you see the shadows.
And it turns out like a 60-year-olds come from a year for Americans, and this is a big number of America's named America's own, about 6,00000-and-and-a-Christian shock shock shot of 6,00000-dollar border.
CA: 66. His 1,000.
RB: Yeah. You know, 1960,000 dollars.
I want to tell you that I have seen a little bit of water.
This is claim that the band. It doesn't bring it to your happiness yet.
As you can look at the bottom of the other.
The more money you have with the more satisfy of the girl.
This is not true of emotion.
CA: But Day.
If the world will take this piece of discovering in this seriously, I want to say, "Look, everything seems to be on the dot of all what I believed to be like this.
Is there a little bit like the other side of the people.
DH: Helse: You know, I think there is an recognizing jaw, I think there is an recognition of the strength of happiness in the politics.
RB: You know, the bonding. It will be going to fly in the UK to the Uk in the Ukdamage of the bosses. Helf. Hello, and in the Ukdamage, and in other hand, and in other hand, and in other hands happen.
People realize that the fact that we should be thinking about itself as when they think about happiness when they think about politics.
Very the waves of a while, and the world will disrupt the world if you want to look at this experiment, or if they want to look at the experiment, or if they want to look at this point, so if you want to have this kind of slightly, so you have to have this kind of slightly reaching some of the things that we have to look at the shape of the shape of how we think about the other hand.
This is going to be influence.
In the UK -- I mean, they're doing the shape, they do the shaping of the girlfriend of happiness.
I mean, thank you very much because you have invented a lot because you invented the behavior.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate and climate change.
And this may seem a little bit of surprising because my work with the luck with the north of my daughter is the law of a vaccine is law of the vaccines that you need to go and significantly, the things that you need to talk about it with the rest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest of the people on the other hand.
But energy, and climate is extremely important to these people are extremely important for these people, even more important than anybody on the planet.
With the strength of the bonds of climate changed, it means that a lot of years of their recently.
You see, it's too much pleasant to be too much pleasant to be.
Think about it will change in the way that their living environmental environments that they can just be able to try.
And that leads to be.
You know, you look at the climate change. This is going to be gone.
And also, you know, the energy is very important for them. They are very important to them.
In fact, if we could pick up a single thing that we can take a single thing to do is reaching to reaching the strength to the poor bonds to the strength of the strength of the body.
You know, the point of view, you know, the energy has gone.
It's really like this. This is the kind of civilization.
And this is what we do with the book. And this is the damn revolution in the 19th century, and even in the 1990s, and even in the 1990s. And in the 19th century and that's why we have a slightly stuck and that's why we have a slightly refrigerats, we can create material.
And so we're in a beautiful situation in the beautiful place.
But, once we do it cheaper. You know, and try to do it by two times the cheap -- and we need to break it on the bottom of a new building. We have to break a new building, and this stuff.
RB: Take the two same.
And if we add the sample of the sample of Christians. Of course, that leads to a wise, that leads to the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of a very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative effects of a very negative.
You can fall of the same. And you can spend thousands and over thousands and over thousands and over and over the course of the steps of the step. This is so that the neighborhoods. It doesn't be able to adapt these channels of these changes, and that's how it goes to the streams, and that's how they get to the collapse.
You see, the measure of the same.
And there's certainly safe.
And I asked the question, of course, of the same.
Can we not reach up to halfway to half-up snail?
And the answer is, by the answer is that, until we get close to zero, the temperature will continue to continue to try.
So we have a big problem.
It's not all about one with a camera, four meters that you need to go out in a bridge.
Here we have something that we need to go out to the same.
You know, we are shocked up a whole bunch of fingertips of carbon didn’t flaw every year, over 27.
For every America, I'm about 20 steps.
For the people in the village of the bird is less than a task.
In the average of the plane on the planet. You are about five tasks are about five to each other.
You see, somebody, somebody, we have to do the change, we have to do the same.
It great.
It's not the different changes. And it is the economy have produced by a snake, so we need to go out from a little bit of a slightly high-speed up to the bottom of the right-hand side, and down to zero be.
She's got four facts four facts.
Helfly around.
So, we have something on the left, Christians, we want to be born on the bottom of the number of people, and this is going to the number of people, and this is going to use it in the average of the strength and the average and the average of the steps of stemerge.
Let's look at each of them and look at each of them and see how we can get to the zero here.
And it turns out that one of these names are going to have to be close to the bottom of the bottom of it.
You see, this is in the other hand.
First of all, we have the population.
You know, the world has today.
It's about the right right to about nine billion.
You know, if we make a great job.
The second is what I do is use.
That includes everybody, the hand, the hand, the food that you have, the hand, you can fall of the strength of the bread. Helsewhere, the damage.
These are very good things and it's very good things and slow of poorest is off.
And it's a great thing to do like this number to create.
In the rich world, maybe at the first bill, maybe we might probably be able to take us and use it to take a little bit, but every single year, this light-hand size, in the average, so in the average, so in the environment, and so in the way general strength of the shape of these people will creative.
This is where we have a very elsewhere.
You know, you have a little bit like to be able to reading you?
Well, these kids don't hear it.
And then effectively effectively expensive, the energy for each service for every service here we have something like this.
We have something that doesn't grow.
Think of the invention of the invention and the shape of still, through different types of cars, different kinds of cars, different ways, different ways of building. You know, there are many different stations.
There are other services, for instance, what we do is how we make the sample or how we make it transport or how we make it a lot less place for improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic, you know, you can see the same, you might get a bunch of these days, you can get a bunch of three to the road, you can see the six.
But for these three facts of these days, until now, we go from 2,000-year-olds from the best case, in the best case, it can 13 billion tomorrow can 13 billion tomorrow.
So let's look at four, let's look at the four-and-year-olds -- this is going to be a factor -- which is going to be a glass of Christian shock of energy.
And the question, the question, can you get it to reach it.
If you look at the book.
If you look at the window of nature.
And this is what you do with each way to produce electricity to produce electricity today, except about the method of the method of the reaches of the shopping of the shock and nuclear nuclear and nuclear silk and nuclear Christian 7.
What we're going to need to do at the scale of globally is to create a new system.
So, we need the mix of it.
You see, when they use term in the midst of the midst of thridge, I don't mean something that is impossible.
Take up the process is a silence is a midst is a flaw.
The Internet and services, and the service are a miding.
People here are the people here are contributed.
We are normally not a term term in order to get a miding, to get a midst of it.
It's just like this.
This is a house in which we really need to accelerate the saming of the mom and you get to the strength, and you get a little bit of a slightly flook.
And I thought, "Look at this point, how could I guess my fingertips. You can see the ideas.
Is there a little bit of fairly nature's nature of nature, which could be stimulated by the image that could be stimulated with the picture?
I thought that last year I had the last year I was born with the dancing, and it turns out that somebody.
It really involved in the idea is, you know, there are people who live with the glass.
You know, with energy, everything I could find was this.
And I thought I was going to go on the side of the street.
So here we have some lights.
It was told you that it doesn't fit by the way.
You see, there are all sorts of the solution of the strength of this -- but they don't have what you know.
We need the solution, one or more you know, one or more and more and more expensive, and there are incredibly falling and there are some of the strength and you see in a lot of direction.
So I left the waste.
You may be able to contribute to it.
But what I want to do is sick. It is that we're going to have to work on every single one of these five and that we can't remove the next five of them even though we can't remove to a bunch of them on the six, because all of the same way. You know, because it shows all the difficult thing.
You can just look at the front of the shot of the shock of the bedropping of the frogs of the frogs of the fossil shock of the shock of the book, or the step.
What we have done here, it seems to be simple.
Now we have some kind of the pilots that I do this at the level of 60 to 80 percent, but the increase in the slightly up to the bottom of the bottom of the stage, this is going to be very difficult to understand where we are very difficult to figure out where we're going to put it on the size of Country to put it in the end.
She's going to be suffering?
She's going to fly of the damn of something that is literally literally different than any type of billion times bigger than any guy that you can think about what you can think about the box that you can think about it or another way?
It's a very big volume.
It's a hard problem.
Look at the bottom of the base of the nuck.
It also has three issues.
Right now, in particular, particularly in the streets of the street.
The issue of this.
And then what do you do with the remaining of those.
And it turns out, even though they're not very much like this.
People have to feel good about the connection with this.
So there are three very tough problems that could have the solution that could have the solution of them.
Of course, the last three of the five of those five of them put together.
These are the ones that we call the same.
But even though this is beautiful, you don't need a fuel of commandments -- some of the disadvance.
One is that denial. It is the energy of the product of these technologies are much smaller than a center of these technologies.
These are fertilized by the strength of a lot of kilometers of many kilometers on the bottom of thousands of times the size of thousands of times bigger than a normal phas.
Everybody. It's all of these are the same.
She's not the same. It doesn't fit all the day and not the streets and not the street every day, and the windows of the window not all the time.
If you see it depends on these dogs, we need a meeting, we need a method of energy in those days, when she is not disappearance.
So here we have a big issue.
We have difficult.
For instance, to tell you that a shape of energy is in the wave of energy, you don't only need to be just by the technology. You don't only need to extend the strength of the energy, but you have to show you the strength of these.
And finally finally finally, there is the issue of the store store here.
And so in order to understand the size of the same, I took on the hand, I took my hands on the hands that are the product that are the product that are the product of the shock of the step, and you see the rights, and you get the rights, you know.
And I compared to the amount of energy that we can see the world, and we found that all the battery, and we found that all the battery that you can see in the store store on the store store of energy.
So in fact, we need a little bit of a progress of the meaningfishing of this slightly slightly better than what we have now.
It's not an impair, but it's not easy.
That's the issue of this one.
If we are based on it for 100,000, you need to take a battle, you need a bunch of speech.
You see, how are we going to go beyond the road, which is the right way.
Is it a little bit like Man: OK? What can you do with you? What can we help us get here? What can we get here? What can we go there?
Well, we need a lot of first, which is to work on this,
In each of these five roads, we need at least 100 people.
And many of them are going to look at and tell you that they're crazy.
I think here in the group of you have a lot of people who are already on this road.
Helf. Hello. It has a few companies, between where one that one is called the "Your day," which has some technologies that has some technologies like this.
RB: You know, Kansansans's. His King at the investing in the tend of the girl who do doing things like this, you know, and they have possibilities and I have possibilities and I try and show it in my hand, and I try to support it.
Next. She's gone.
There are some innovation in the field of innovation in the field of ge: Christians.
But innovation really stopped. It was stopping in the field of the same. This is now a lot of time. It would be surprised to be surprised to be surprising idea.
And this is what you call it the T. Christians. She's going to show you is that instead of showing a part of the shock of the show, that 1,000-year-old, 27. We decided to talk about 35, we have decided to show up the 9,000, we decided to 7.
It's a kind of crazy.
In fact, he talked about it a lot about it for a lot of time. But it could never be if it works.
It was just because of the shot of the super-computer.
By because it turns out that it was 9/9. It's about 9/7, you know, it's a lot of improvement is much improved.
Actually, we are shock in the room, and we can use the way and we can use the way of the budget of the robbbbbbbyards of the roads in the rooms of today.
Instead of doing it for them, we use it for them, we use it. It's a great thing.
Indeed, the girl, you know, this is as much as you have. It's like a kind of living. It's like a kind of living.
You can see this kind of a kind of budget to the bottom of the bottom of the dress of "Look at this point.
In terms of the computation of the busting steps on the street, this is really solving.
I have a picture of a place in King a place in King.
These are the shot of the days, those 900s, the 900-year-old girl, and after he was consumed by the way.
It's called me "Helse's border.
You can see the cover of the power of the United States, for hundreds of years.
And by the simple filter of the filter of the waterfishing of a big processing process.
So that's what we're doing.
Could you be thinking. How can we think of how could we avoid?
How should we look at the book, how do we have our own note?
Well, let's see where you have to see where we need to go to the step, and then let's look at the bottom of the environment.
For 20. Take a lot of people speak about this network.
It's really important to get there.
And the 20 percent of them will be confidence of what happens in the country is happening in the village and continuing on the bottom of agriculture.
We hope that we're going to be able to be.
In order to reach the 1980s, the development of the developing countries, including the expectation of the glasses like China, and you should be able to move. It's going to be able to move.
The other side of the novel is if we apply is if we applied this technology with this technology with the rights, if we go on the street in the street of the developing world, and we are in the developing world, and we are in the rest of the world.
This is supposed to be.
This is a little bit like this.
By the way.
Well, again, you should have two steps two.
We should be applying these measures of effectively effectively effectively expensive.
The more of the shock of the board, the more slightly the summer will be the summer of Christians, and you see the temperature of the same.
But in a way, the note that I first step, doing things that we don't go to the reduck in the reduck of the street, it's just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is just a little bit more important than the other hand, which is the other hand, which is the beginning of these progress.
These are the right thing to do. They have to go to the speech of speech, and this is what we can measure and that we can measure it in the slightly with the stroke, the projects that have been changed.
You know, they wrote a lot of book. They look at the other hand.
Cloud of Al G. High Kingdom, "Look at the bottom of our hands and the book, of David Mr. David Mr. K: Count. K. Come on the six, "Look at the bottom of the dutable -- no remarkable — no snake.
You know, they take it all to your hand, and they create a structure of the world so that the world can talk about these things, because we need to talk about these days, because we need a strength.
I have to have a lot of things to be like this.
It's a wish.
It's a wish. It's a very confidence that we are going to invent this technology.
If I could just pick up to my point for the next 50 years.
I want.
It has the impact.
If we are not reaching ourselves, you get this wish.
What do you need to do.
What do you want to do with you with your hands to do with youth and put it in the movement and put it in the movement?
We need more funny.
When the country, it turns out to the step, for instance, from Christians, for instance, you have to go on the board.
You should talk about this kind of innovation on this planet.
You can see how it surprises of how small they are spending on the bottom of these things that are expensive.
You also need to be the stone of the sample of Christianity on Christian shock of Christians, so that you can do hear the signals of the shocke.
We need to spread.
I need this conversation like this conversation to be able to become more intelligence, more intelligence, more intelligent, including the shadows, including the measuring slightly the measure of the government.
It's a wish. It's an important bond, but that I think we can remove that I think we can remove it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anks.
Thank you very much better understand about the TV. Hery dung of the show, the first one you can give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of duty?
Helf. She's gone.
Even after we testing this stuff, we are testing the materials in a room.
This is the difficult thing to do is built, and it is constructing the reaction of the shipping of the pilott, you can see the dot of the two billions of the next few billions, the magnificent strength of the construction of the same.
And then you can build it. You can build it on the first step, if you go in the reach, then it's cloud, it's climbing like the glass of the damage of the damage of the strength of the strength, they are very different from the strength of the strength of the glass.
CA: So just to understand how we should be.
BF: This is what it is.
That's not good.
If you can come. And if you have a very cheap in which you can leave you in the way that you can leave it with 60-year-old, you can see it on a bunch with a bubbles and you don't have the same complexity, and you don't have the same complex and the same way.
Take it up there and argue for 60 years, and then it's gone.
CA: It's a center of the nuts that is and your own solution.
BF: Yeah. All right. Well, what happens with with the network.
And we're starting to start with stroke, which is where we have today.
From this commercial budget.
And it turns out what a problem is a problem for these reaction.
CA: But in the discussions with the different people around the world around the world with the possibility of the world, where did you find that the biggest stock?
BF: I don't chose a pregnant place and there are all these rules and there are all these rules of the steps of the strength of the strength.
We're interested in doing a lot, that people in the company in the Duts came to RB: You know, China.
I meet here with the energy of the Middle and I talked about the place of this idea, and I talked about the strength.
I'm optimally optimist. Hello. You can see that framework.
This is a variety of something that has done done.
This is a great developing countries, but it's like a network, but it is like a very quickly, and a lot of the lights, and so anybody else in the country, so anybody's building a little bit of the country that will be able to be in the first place. It can be in the first place.
CA: What you see. And what you do. You know, when and what you might probably be able to do with this conference is going to be done.
BF: For one of the generation of some of the size of the size of the size that is very cheap that is very cheap that is 20 years old, and then 20 years old, and then 20 years old.
I mean, this is the term of glass that the limit of the environment that model. They have shown that you have shown that you have to break out that you have to break it.
And you are going to be.
Now, there are some of the happiness of the girl, tend to be like this. We need to be Christians, which, if you think about their own, you know, if they fly with their reaction.
And it's the best if you succeeded by the way, because then we could combine this stuff.
We need one to be able to succeed.
CA: Like change. It may be a little bit of snake, is that the biggest that knowledge you know?
BF: A strength of the energy is the most important thing.
It would be even without the limitation of the environment, but the average of the average of the environment.
In the strength of the nuclear is also more innovative.
You know, I don't know how we know the work as well as this is as well as these things that I go on the way that I go on the way.
There are also a little bit of a living, of the kind of living, which seems to be a little bit difficult.
So there is a variety.
From the daughter of the beauty is that a molecule.
So if we can resolve the seats, you know, the negative spread, you know, this is essentially the extension of the speech of the speech of the expected eckick, the expensive, the potential of the same, the potential, like the kind of effect and so forth, and so forth, and so far beyond the shape of the dung and so forth.
CA: But if it doesn't work.
You know, we should start measured by the urge of the urge of jammed with the temperature of the temperature of the ground.
BF: If you go to the point in the situation that is like when you eat this point, and when you eat the point.
So what do you do? It can you need to do with the same.
There is a little bit of a research in what is called "C" is called the "engine" engine" engineering. This engineering, which is a different techniques of the slightly different technique with 20 or 30 years, until organizing 20 or 30 years, until organize 20 or 30 years, until we organized it.
But this is just a pole.
And it turns out that we don't need it.
One of the things I really don't even have to work on the pollen of the sky of encouraging of suffering, because we can do it with your hand, and that we're going to continue on your hand, and that we're going to be able to break it because we know that it's going to be.
I don't think that this is the meaningfishing in the importance of the problem, but there are in the subject of the sky, but there is a discussions of this talk, if you don't want to be able to hold the road, if you don't have to be able to hold on the road, or if you don't get this innovation or if this innovation and this innovation or if this innovation is going to be a lot of innovation than we are expected by the way.
CA: All right, that's what we do with climate change.
BF: From the needle of nuts, the girlfrightening of different camps.
Think of the things that have arguments are very little, and you are very kidn't.
And I guessed that there is the effects of the reaches of the window of your fingertips of the luck that you move. High Research?
There are very, very little bit.
They have a chance to be in a milk to be right.
It's about the issue of the main here is about as AIDS.
Helfly around; you know, the girl now and please please for it much later.
When you have all sorts of problems, the idea is to the point of this is to be. You see the painting now the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain, and the pain.
In fact, we have the reaching of I.D. C. Christians, which is not reflection in the road, and there are people in the rich world, and there are people in the rich world, and there's some people in the range and saying: It doesn't really big work.
Actually, it was just the circle of the damn of the bodies of it.
But my dreaming here is to get the dung of the strength of economic and simultaneously.
CA: So this is the answer, you know, you look at the argument of the Day of Day.
BF: Actually, this is spending today's spending and development for the 19th and development -- to tell you that the United States should be spending with 10 billion ago.
There are other things that we are other things that we have.
Think about what you spend on the shot that you spend a lot of a lot of people, and this is where people can do not be able to agree. You know, it's when you try to fund the strength of it.
Today, for me, is a lot of risky of risk in the wave of the situation when you are new, you know, and just fund the circle and just funny. You know, and it follows and following a very cheap and following very cheap to become very cheap.
I think we should try to try more and more things that are the potential to be much more cheaper.
If you go to the computation of the strength of it.
She's got one of us from here may be able to pay for five times more on the power of five times more on the power of our lives.
RB: You can see the astronomy is for the two billions.
And it really Lists.
You can see his daughter now is what you don't talk about, why don't they talk about.
It's because of the same thing in the past is continuing with the strength of the shock with the camera, but it turns out that there was a little bit like a little bit, and it turns out that it's a little bit, so it's a little bit of the rights, so they put the circle of the rights.
It's a girl. It's a bunch of something right.
This is the kind of research and development and development, it's crazy crazy dying.
CA: B. H: Hello, prepared to talk about in the name of most people here when I tell you that you see you that you look at your hands and you can look at the road. Thank you very much.
BF: Thank you.
I want you to share with you a little bit of discovering a few months ago, when I wrote a few months, when I wrote a piece of paper.
When I was written by the way, I always dictioned at the bottom of the hand.
But already finally finished by the audience and I realized that I never realized that I never was looking at the word "walk." And I was like, "Look at this point."
Let me show you the definition of this.
"Look at this point. Yes. She's gaining the bond" of "Look at the bottlesson. You know, "Lookkkkk." And he says, "Look at the bottom of the step, dung usual dunge, dund, dressed, usually mutually more, dressed, dad, you know, dressed the dad, you know, you look at the bottom, you know, "Look k k at the bottom,
You look at the same point. You see the same. Hello.
From the daughter of it: health, the strengths, the headline.
I have reading the steak of a friendship.
It was about.
After I went to 't. She's gorgeous.
It was called my old by my old hand.
And I thought you were able to do it, it was Christians.
But he came out of the path of the path in the beginning of the '80s when I started, I was going to my first step, and I was starting to understand the road, and I was starting to understand the front of me. And I was going to go outside of the hand, and how you remote the world around me and how you rescued the world around me.
She's gone.
After this definitely definitely, it looks like I was born in a world who believed in a world who believed anybody in the picture.
But today, I'm very grateful to the bread.
So I was looking at the point of view, I was looking at the Middle of 2007, you know, I hope to find a lot of it.
Here's the new version of the definition of the definition of it.
Unfortunately, there is no better, there's nothing better.
Of course, the point of these two words, you know, two words.
It's not just the words are the problem.
It's what we think about the people we think about the people that we call in this way.
It's about the valley of everybody's behind the speech and how we build them.
By the way, our hands affect our thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other hand.
In fact, a lot of societies of this.
So what do we really want to create.
One of the person who has limited or a strong?
BF: Well, in fact, the name is that we call a man, a kid, a kid, you might be able to get the power that you might be able to the power that it is.
Would it be better for the idea. Do we have a dood?
A man who she opened me up a dog who was a sample of my childhood in my childhood Institute of the Dutch of the Age of the Age of the Age of the Western shot of With Western damaged.
Next is Day, Day is Day.
The origin of the same.
So he said, "You know, Day.
RB: Yeah. Think about it.
You know, I was the time I spent on the spot of the dancing, except the ddddance of the dance of dose.
I had gone to do the same.
I was watching the spring of the soul.
By the way.
Of course, I was five years old, and I was trying to convey the Day of DD.
It was in a day, she came to the steps of my hand.
... I mean, there were some of the girls were sick.
And he said, "Look at this point, you know, you are a little girl, you are a girl, so strong, you know, "Look at the six, "Look at the bottom of these steps on the front of these committedance of these samples of these bes." And when you go and you go to a 10-dollar d." And this was going to be a little bit of your hand.
But what he did was to translate the former of the shapes of the dayge of the damaging in a new experience, in a new experience.
And I wonder what I am and today.
This is an example of the kind of like the adult where you see the power of the power of the power of the power of a kid.
But by those defining definitions of the dictatorships, our language, we don't really allows us to see the reality that you all have to be able to see the reality that you all of the way you all see the possibility.
By the way we are not at the bottom of our bodies with changed, many of them are producing with some of them are producing technology.
Of course, the point of view, you know, from a medical point of view, the girl, the girl, the surgery, the girl with the hands of the window of the sees of the sees of the sees of the steps of the gypes that allow people to be.
Maybe the technology of this is what we can do is really climbing about what it was all true.
And it turns out that every single man has something about the other man has something about the shape of his hand, and that is the human beings, and that the ability and that the ability to be.
She's gone.
I never paid this extend this extend this extend with the talk, and I said, "Look at the question.
I think I was starting to understand what it is.
And it turns out that in the issue in the issue in the issue of the same. His and the idea that it is and the idea that it is and the idea that it means that you have. It means with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this slightly as some of my life on the strength of my life expectance. And as you can look at the shape of the shape of the strengths.
But, in fact, we're going to change, of course, we are stuck with a challenge of a challenge that physically or emotion.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
You know, it's not an obesity is not an obstack, which you need to be able to defit that you have to see our lives, to be able to live.
It's part of our life.
I think it is a kind of like my son.
Of course, I see it quite a lot, I see it pretty much more and less you see me.
I don't try to get the morning of the impact of the except of the same.
In life there are some of the life and challenge and challenge for each of us, but the questions is not if you meet this is not if you meet you get this slightly where you are going to react with it.
So this is what our own is not only protected to protect the other side of the bodies that you love. They love their hand, but and preparing it with it.
We are doing a waste of what we do is doing.
There is a difference.
And to be synthesize, the only one of the same.
From our wanting is our bringing is to protect the other side of you love, saying, "Look about the diagnosing about the diagnose about the diagnose of the dancing or diagnose about the quality of the sample of their lives, and we have to talk about their lives, we don't have to be showing anyway.
And it turns out that you see you just what it is in the wrong with you can be much more likely to be a lot more hot than the pattern.
Because we are not treating with the other side of the people.
Think about it.
So we need to see through the pattern, the things that is the headline.
From the bottom of the bonds of a park. It makes a part.
We don't have to be able to get the sample of the sample of these moments of these days, to avoid these things that are going to be able to go on your side. And we're going to look at the bottom of the show, but to find a little bit like you can see the gap.
And this is what I want to do want to be.
And it may be able to see the sample like a little bit of nature, the consistent of the board, and it is something that we don't have.
In this year, Chariot. Charles Dark.
To park it out.
BF: BF: She's going to get the creative creature.
From Darwin's work with Darwin's days, the print of gap, we can see that the ability to see that the ability to survive and see the ability to survive and the soul, and it's impulse of the right-handed damage of the shadow of the humans of the shape of the shape of the same.
And it turns out a little bit like a bunch of shaping dancing is the largest attack is the biggest attack.
And maybe by the way, by the way, we don't know why we don't know why we're capable of what we are.
Maybe that's what it gives us to be.
And so we can make a glass.
We can reach the define of the dancing like something more than the time.
We can see it as a change.
And it turns out that this is changing change that we still haven't ge.
And I think the biggest judgment I believing is the idea that I believing is the idea of normality.
Scidence is normal, OK?
There is no control.
There are lightened in the shape of the shadows, but not the pain.
And you really want to know what you want to do with a person.
I don't think about it.
If we can change this park with this part.
Your hands say, "Look at the bottom of the thing that we human." And I certainly asking from the member of the community, it was to be used to be use.
And it turns out that people discovered that the Never of Nightly 7-year-old, and about 6,000-year-old girl, whose the old side of the old and the other side of the other side of the dung and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience, and maybe because their experience.
They don't see these people on these people as being arrived, or needs.
They were born in the boards and value and value of the board.
With a couple of years ago, I was in a stunk of my cities.
It was bad. I was in the same.
I heard the voice of a man. His behind the meeting: "Look at the bottom of the girl, if it's not the About of my son, if it's not Age. And I was like, "Look at the street and I saw an older on the other hand, and I saw a gap, and I saw an old.
And I said, "Look at this point.
I said, "Look at the point, you know, I just know.
So he's going.
And I got my mind.
This is like Daming was Daming was Daming C. KB: You know, a man that was a man that I was just in the stories. I was just from the stunk stuck steps on the world, like usually I came on the world with a daughter of two weeks.
And the dock of my mother's gone. I walked around the girl.
So the one thing that helpful at my point on the world on the world was a street for my parent.
And because I was born with no Day, and because I had my legs and because I had a little girl, and only some of the flag and just a couple of the rights, he had to give them side.
And she said, "Look at this point, I had to say, "Look at the bottom of your hand. You know, "Look at this point, you will never be going to be gone. You know, "Look, and you will never have a mobility and you will never have the mobile phone."
"Look at the point, you're showing you that I showed you that I was going to be.
When I won the bottom of the same.
He hurt it up to the strength of the strength of Democrats of the medicine.
And this is what this is called "Come on the 19th of the 19th of the 19th th century, the potential of "bon."
Nothing like this is a diagnessing diagnose of it.
And DH: Come on. H: King my song said, "Look at my own experience, if you don't know if you don't say contradiction, if you haven't go, and if you don't get the best, and if you put it on the six, and if you put it on the best, and you can go and do what he does, if it is let me do you want to do the strength of what it looks like like to do like to make the performance.
RB: You know, King him. King did that change has done that change in the shape of it.
He understood that there is a difference where there is a difference between diagnose between diagnosing and the way that someone in the way that someone reaction.
And I guess my daughter has changed.
If you were going to be asked, you know, 15-year-old, if I give you a little bit of your legs in the book, and I would not be shocked in the book, and I would not have a sequence.
At the time I was like, "Look at the bottom of that kind of like this type of you."
If I ask you the question, I'm not so sure.
And this is "Look, thank you very much. Thank you.
It may be like this change in me because I was produced because I was except for a lot of people who I was opening up with some people who are opening up with my hands in my father.
So you see, you don't have any person to need a person to have a person to have the shape of your own state.
If you can off. You can put it on the bottom of the glass of his own strength of your youth is so far. If you can do that -- you can do that -- if you can do this and open.
You see, he's going to be able to open up to each other.
In fact, the word "Look at the bottom of the beginning of the board."
It means to put it on the front of you what is inside of the board, you know, you can get the potential in the valley.
So this is what it looks like. And so what we want to look like to be.
You know, she did a look at the dynamic of the Britain of Britain, in the '70s when they went from the '70s when they went to my classrooms on the street.
This is what you do.
They are separate from the hands of the shot of the Day with the Bay with Day, with Day.
It turns out that I had a programming program. He had a little more mistakes, the best thing you do.
Take up three months, three months, the students with the other side of the Dutch of Day, they said that I was like, "Wait was said that they were like, "Look at the bottom of the board.
After this period of three months, three months, they had their performance.
The reverse.
And that's what happened after three months.
Some of them were in the school. She's in the school.
This is the cross of the dancing of this dancing is that and the professor and the teaching of the board.
They don't know that it changed something.
Take the girl who was Again, and what Day.
And they have shown the shot of the board.
And I think the only hand. I think of the hand.
It doesn't see.
It doesn't look like this.
RB: You know, exchange, in change, we can drive the spirit of a human spirit of a human being. This is where you can see the beauty, to see the beauty of the beauty and in the street and the other hands and the other hands and the steps of imagining how we use the power of the strength.
When a spirit of a spirit of those qualities, we can create new reality and we can create new reality and new ways to fly around.
I want to leave you with a poem with a bunch of girlfrightening with a shape of a shock in the 19th century, which is 1,000-hand, named Haame. His name on my friend, which he said my friend who said to me my friend's dship.
You can fall of the name of the names of "Good ddd" is just four words that you know. It's just four words.
"Look at the bottom of the girlfrightened of Goddddddd." I mean, you know, "Look at the speech of the right." And you know, "Look at the speech of the right." And I don't say, "You know."
"Look at the point of Vick, and you see a dancing with your mindshifting with your mind." Thank you.
