A few years ago, here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  He <unk> a design design for the <unk>
And the idea is pretty <unk>
<unk> of four <unk> you have to <unk> the most <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>  and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> has to stay in <unk>
And although it looks quite <unk> it's actually quite <unk> because it <unk> people to <unk> <unk>  because they <unk> people to <unk> <unk>  <unk>
And so I thought this is a <unk> idea, and I <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
And it was a big <unk>
And since that time, I <unk>  about <unk> design all over the world  with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and something out of this <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and I would like to <unk> <unk>
So, <unk> people start to <unk> <unk>
They talk about it, how it will it <unk>  <unk> it <unk>  And then they <unk> a little bit of time they <unk> their <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> most of the <unk>  <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and then, even when they don't have time,  <unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> it <unk> <unk> and <unk> it <unk>
They <unk> their <unk>
But what's happening in fact, in most of the <unk>  is that the <unk> is that the <unk> is <unk> into a <unk> because the <unk> <unk> is to <unk> and <unk>
And there is a number of people -- which have a lot of <unk> more <unk> than <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
They <unk> <unk> their <unk> and their <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And of course, there are a lot more <unk> <unk> <unk> and some of the <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk>
And it's pretty <unk>
As <unk> tells us <unk>  not only produce the <unk> <unk>  but also the most <unk> of the <unk>
So you would like to <unk>  How do we <unk>
And <unk> <unk> them like to <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> of the children doesn't lose the time to be <unk>
And we don't <unk> the time for <unk>
But there's another <unk>
This is that <unk> are <unk>  to find out the only <unk> right?
And we <unk> it.
And what happens is that when I put the <unk> in the <unk>  I'm in <unk> <unk> and what's going on.
It's a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What they do different kids from the <unk>  is that they start with the <unk>  and they build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk>  like <unk> <unk> <unk>
And every <unk> the kids have a <unk> <unk>  <unk> what they work and what they don't <unk>
So what the ability to build in <unk> is <unk> to <unk> and see how different <unk>
So the media <unk> is about 20 <unk>  <unk> are a little bit <unk>  <unk> a little bit better, but not with <unk> <unk> <unk> more than most <unk>
Who is the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>  The <unk> <unk> <unk> that I have <unk> has <unk> <unk>
And why is it <unk> Because they understand that <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> <unk> a little bit better than <unk>
But here it becomes interesting.
If you <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> you look at <unk> and <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk>
You can say that <unk> And why is it?
Because they have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> get <unk>
And any team that <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> to the <unk>  and it's <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> is <unk>
If you have 10 <unk> that start to <unk>  you're going to have about six <unk> that will stay in the <unk>
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what <unk> that happened to those <unk> <unk>
What was the <unk>
Here's what <unk>
The team team has not been built something that <unk> in <unk>
If about a team would have been <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk>  They could take home home <unk>
So, it's not interesting that the big <unk>  have a huge <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> <unk>
What do you <unk>
<unk> now have <unk> the value of <unk>
And the same team has gone from the <unk> <unk> to one of the best <unk>
They have the most <unk> structure in the <unk>
So here are some <unk> <unk> for us to talk about the nature of <unk> and the <unk>
So you might <unk> Why <unk>  <unk> someone lost time this kind of <unk>
And the reason is, I look at the <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And what this <unk> <unk> is that it helps to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because in fact,  every project has its own <unk> right?
So this challenge <unk> us a <unk> experience of <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by the way, this is the value of this <unk> <unk> so <unk>
And for those <unk>  You can <unk> <unk> <unk>  It's a <unk> where you can see how to <unk> with <unk>
They are also <unk> <unk>
There are <unk> examples of all around the world  how people change and <unk> <unk>
You can also find <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> I think is that <unk> is really <unk>  a <unk> <unk>
It <unk> us to <unk> all the <unk>  and <unk> what we have better in the <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  for the <unk> in front of us.
And <unk> a simple <unk> of this <unk>  is the only thing that it <unk> to transform  a <unk> moment in a <unk> moment.
And that can make <unk>
Thank you very much.
Let's say that we have a <unk>  a big <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And that is a <unk> <unk>
And all of the <unk> in this room, you have to <unk>
You can go back or <unk>  but you can't stay where you <unk>
And I ask <unk> <unk> <unk> I asked him this question <unk>  <unk> and everybody wanted to go back over time.
They don't have <unk> they want to <unk> before <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
I don't know.
I'm sure there is a certain <unk>  <unk>
But I have to <unk> that I'm not part of this <unk>
I don't want to go back to time and not because I have no <unk> <unk>  but because I have no <unk> <unk> on this planet  but because I don't <unk>
So I want to <unk> in the car and go <unk>
It's the best time of this <unk>  <unk> any <unk> you <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was no longer <unk>
All of my <unk> died  before I was <unk>
My <unk> came to the <unk>
My <unk> is <unk>
So it would be good for me to be a new <unk> in the beginning that I'm going to <unk>
But it's not even about people like <unk> because it's much more important than <unk>
A kid who is <unk> in New York <unk>  has a <unk> of life than the most <unk> human <unk> in the world about 100 years ago.
Think about that. It's a <unk> <unk>
And why is it <unk>
<unk> <unk> has <unk> billions of people.
He <unk> the <unk> data of the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> way.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
In the world of <unk> <unk> <unk> million people just <unk> a <unk> <unk>  no more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> anyone knows what all <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  our ability to <unk> billion people are the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I <unk> that <unk> <unk>  put things on the <unk> <unk> to see if the <unk> to change them if not,  <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
These are good <unk>
<unk> there's no longer and some other <unk>  because there are <unk> many times,  One of them is that in all of our <unk> --  -- in all of our <unk> --  every day.
This number is growing very <unk> and it's really <unk> <unk>
Not just <unk> but we have used <unk> to <unk> this planet.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> are all on the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
If you don't <unk> a way to <unk> out of this <unk>  We're going to <unk>
The question is: Can I do it?
I think it's obvious that we can produce <unk> and <unk> billion people without <unk> <unk> that we <unk>
I think we can <unk> this world  with energy that is not going to <unk>
I really think this is not just a <unk>
But this is what I didn't expect me to <unk> the night --  One of the things that didn't expect me to <unk>
We never had a lot of <unk> <unk> than now and we have never found in the <unk>  to use it in the way we can do today.
We're in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  in many more <unk>
<unk> I think we should go back with three hundred years <unk>  And over time, before the <unk> <unk> <unk>  to discover a period when we <unk> for <unk> <unk> --  -- all of these things with more <unk> than now.
People are <unk> their <unk>  that you can't <unk>
<unk> even the truth will not <unk>
Everybody has the right to a <unk>  <unk> actually has the right to have a <unk> of <unk> but you know what you don't have <unk>
You don't have to your <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> but that's how it <unk>
And it took me a while to realize that.
So about 10 years ago, I wrote a story about <unk> <unk>  for <unk> New <unk> a little <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> to be part of the <unk>  The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the entire history of <unk>
<unk> <unk> what to <unk>  so I did what I do, I did do what I do, I <unk> a little <unk> went on.
<unk> after that,  I wrote a story about <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> only more important.
People have <unk> <unk>
So I wrote a <unk> and this <unk> and I couldn't understand why  and I couldn't understand why  <unk> people think it's a <unk> <unk>  Why do you think it has <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
But as I <unk> do what I <unk> I wrote <unk> I went on.
I'm just <unk>  <unk> <unk> we go to <unk> everything <unk>
But these <unk> <unk> me <unk>  and I didn't realize that <unk> Then I <unk>
It was because those <unk> who <unk> me from the <unk>  They were not <unk>
They were people with <unk> <unk> to their <unk>
They were just like people in this <unk>
And he <unk> me so <unk>
But then I <unk> let's be <unk>
We are at the point that we don't have the same <unk> with <unk> as it now.
We talk about it <unk>
We talk about it in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
OK, there are reasons why I think we know what are these <unk>
We lost <unk> in the <unk>  and sometimes even in <unk>
And we have to do it.
You can <unk> a couple of <unk> and people will <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can <unk> your own <unk>
There are questions and problems --  <unk> to people who are always <unk>
So <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
There is no good <unk>
But this is <unk> when you <unk> <unk>  We have to <unk> them. We don't really <unk>
And I can also say that we are in the middle of a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> until now, and I hope that I am not going to <unk>
<unk> 12 years ago, <unk> a <unk>  -- a <unk> one <unk>  -- which was the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They made <unk> <unk> to <unk> if this is true.
It really <unk> to make <unk> it's a <unk> problem.
They came and <unk>
The <unk> in the United States, in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> and all the <unk> the same <unk> there is no <unk>  no <unk> <unk>
We're not <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> we take to the <unk> <unk>  We think what we find is that we <unk> what makes us <unk>
We don't think a lot of <unk>  <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that gives us <unk> and I think we understand that <unk>
But you know <unk>
<unk> have been <unk> and this is <unk> and this is the United States is one of the <unk> countries in the world --  where the rate of <unk> against <unk> is in <unk>
This is <unk>  We should be <unk>
It's <unk>
What happened  I got <unk>
<unk> even <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> someone in the audience ever ever ever <unk>
It's not so much.
In <unk> this doesn't happen <unk>  but it happened <unk> times the world last year.
A lot of <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But because here we haven't <unk> we <unk> we can not think about it and people like <unk> <unk> <unk>  I can <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I can do that because I don't do the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
They don't understand that the same thing, but they never <unk>
And we have to <unk> that how <unk>
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk>
<unk> of one of the largest <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in the middle -- not <unk>
<unk> Paul <unk>
<unk> that has developed a <unk> against a <unk> with other <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> every year.
<unk> <unk> right?
It's just good that Paul <unk> talks about <unk> and <unk> and that people should just <unk>
That's how it works.
So Paul is a <unk>
When Paul is <unk> in a <unk> <unk>  can't <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> at home  because people like to tell me  And I know what school go to <unk>
Why? Because Paul made a <unk>
It doesn't need to say that, but <unk> are <unk>
If you <unk> them <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> and that's what happens now.
In this country we have now <unk>
It's more and more and more <unk> <unk>  children will be <unk> again because of that, <unk> is just a <unk> problem.
And they will not only <unk>
What about <unk> What about <unk>
Two weeks ago, a <unk> was <unk> by <unk> he wrote to me to be <unk>
No one ever told me that.
It didn't have to <unk> the child against <unk>
In any <unk>
All right.
Why? Because we don't have <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> not <unk> cases of <unk> in <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> can't <unk> a guy <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it will <unk> on the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> right now it's over the <unk> <unk>
It's going to <unk> over two <unk> is going to <unk> a car <unk>  and will come to one of these <unk> <unk> TED <unk> in this <unk>
It doesn't know that it's <unk> with a disease that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we are not <unk> because it works the world.
This is the planet that we <unk> <unk> <unk> that it's not like that.
We like to think about <unk> We like this at <unk>
It took everybody <unk> <unk>
<unk> a little bit <unk>  to <unk>
You know you have done it because half the U.S. the U.S. is doing this <unk>
<unk> these things and look at the <unk> <unk> and it doesn't matter how often they are completely <unk>
<unk> show every time the same thing.
<unk> make <unk> more <unk> and <unk> nothing more.
It's in the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
Why do we do that?
I think -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We don't have <unk>
And we shouldn't be <unk> our health <unk> is <unk>
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's incredibly <unk> and it's incredibly <unk> to the people who <unk> the <unk>
So he <unk> <unk> And he <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
But, in fact, there is something very <unk>  because these things are <unk> and <unk>
I have all kinds of <unk> <unk>
<unk> of them -- <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> that I don't even know what it is,  <unk> billion dollars on that, <unk>
And you know <unk> When I say that, people <unk> to me <unk> <unk> <unk> people to do what they <unk>  <unk> <unk> people to do what they <unk>  It makes them <unk>
<unk> <unk> Thank you.
Because I don't care --  if the <unk> of the state in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> is the one who says <unk> don't have a <unk>  My <unk> my <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
When a <unk> on the way that I <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in South Africa of <unk> <unk>
He <unk> <unk> people <unk>  <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  are much more <unk> than the <unk> <unk>  that we know the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of thousands of <unk> absolutely <unk>  in a country <unk>  more than any other <unk> of this <unk>
I <unk> I don't <unk>  that there is no <unk> for that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> us right now --  that has <unk> us right now --  of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> We need to <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> to <unk>
It's <unk> not <unk>
<unk> I <unk> every <unk> <unk> <unk>  every <unk> <unk> <unk>   -- every <unk> of <unk>  was <unk> by <unk>
In <unk> <unk> don't <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We were not <unk> <unk> We did.
I've been doing this for the last <unk> years.
Some of them have been in <unk> some of them are not <unk>
I have <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now we can do it in a more <unk> way.
<unk> there are <unk>
But we can put <unk> in <unk>  and that can help millions of people,  and that can help millions of people, <unk>
You're not going to do that?
We have to <unk> that we don't <unk>
<unk> against <unk> <unk>
Why do we do that?
We always <unk> things like <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> we don't want the <unk>  <unk> we don't want the <unk>  <unk> <unk> we don't want <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want companies to <unk> <unk>
We don't want companies to <unk> <unk>
<unk> my answer to all <unk>
Yes, you have <unk> Let's <unk> that.
So this is, we have a big problem with <unk>  but that's not <unk>
This <unk> nothing to do with <unk>
It's <unk> it's <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that <unk> is not <unk> by a <unk>
It's not a <unk>
It's not even a <unk> it's a <unk>
It's a process that sometimes <unk> <unk> and the <unk> no, but the idea that shouldn't be <unk>  <unk> to do the work --  -- because it's very <unk>  and <unk> million people to <unk>
For the next 50 years it's going to have to <unk> <unk> more food than <unk>
Look at the <unk>
This is what <unk> have been done in Africa for the last 30 years.
<unk> <unk>
They need that, and we don't <unk> them.
Why? <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't want to <unk> people to <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
500 million people <unk> <unk>
It's a little bit like a <unk>
It's just <unk> It's <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  And all this on right now.
And then people will be able to <unk> it <unk>
They're not going to <unk> and you know <unk>
It would be good. It would be like <unk> <unk>  but it <unk>
All I can say is:  Why do we <unk>
Let's ask the question, Why do we <unk>
Because we don't want to <unk> <unk>
It's just about <unk> <unk> It's not about <unk>
It's not about our <unk> <unk> for <unk>   <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not about <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>  but about <unk> <unk> people in life -- and it has time to understand what that <unk>
You know <unk>
If we're not <unk> if we're going to continue to <unk> us as we <unk> now,  We're going to be <unk> by something that I don't think we want to be <unk>  which is the <unk> <unk>
We can't describe <unk> what is <unk>
It's <unk> it's <unk>  It's under your <unk> <unk> and you have to <unk>
So after this incredibly <unk> <unk>   You may say <unk> <unk> more <unk> you want to <unk>  in this <unk> machine to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's now <unk> in <unk>  but we have a <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> <unk> we want to do that.
We have to <unk> these <unk> and we have to <unk> <unk>  but when we go back to the <unk> <unk> and we go <unk>
We think that we can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it just takes the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  The <unk> from the center of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was a <unk>  <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a human <unk> <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> that had only two <unk>
And I tell you a story that a lot of <unk> you know, because <unk> wrote a lot of <unk> that have become the basis of a <unk> after a <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> you all to <unk> the book <unk> or to see the film to <unk> not only <unk>  which has <unk> between these two people, but how music has helped the <unk> of that <unk> and then it was <unk> for words, for <unk>  to help <unk> no longer stay <unk>
I met <unk> <unk> in <unk>  two years ago, at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and it came behind the <unk> and <unk>
<unk> in a very <unk> way, and <unk>  about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  and how the <unk> <unk> will never get to the <unk>  And how the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was talking about <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a few days later,  I thought that <unk> was a <unk> of <unk> with me.
Now, we have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> to make <unk>  because when he was doing <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and that left the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and it left the <unk>
But as a result of this is <unk> to <unk>  these <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of them can be <unk> as a <unk>  and <unk> more days, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was very <unk>  when we first first <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk>  had a kind of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  It was <unk>
And I was talking about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and how someone <unk> it <unk>
And it was <unk> to me not to me, but it was <unk>  that I was going to <unk> in one of his <unk> and he was going to <unk> his <unk>  and <unk> and <unk> other forms of <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and other forms of <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and other forms of <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and other forms of <unk> of <unk>
So I started <unk>
And we <unk> the first part of the <unk> for <unk> <unk>
And as I <unk>  I realized that a <unk> change  <unk> in the eyes of <unk>
It was as if it was under the <unk> of <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> that music <unk> me was <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> --  -- a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And as a <unk> <unk> up its own <unk>  and it started to <unk> after the <unk>  some of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we started to talk about the <unk> from the <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>  <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
And I understood that he was not only that he was <unk> <unk> <unk> but he had to do with <unk> <unk>
I was talking about it with the <unk> and the <unk> I <unk> with my <unk>  and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as I was <unk> and <unk> music <unk>  <unk> the guy turned out of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that just <unk> on the <unk>  in the center of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And for <unk> music is <unk>
Because the music allows them to take their own <unk>  and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and his <unk>  in <unk>
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I understood that this is the <unk> <unk>
This is the reason that we make <unk>  We take something that <unk> in our <unk>  — our <unk> and our <unk> and our <unk> <unk> and our <unk> <unk> <unk> those <unk> in the <unk>
And the reality of that <unk>  <unk> us on the <unk>  and we <unk> our <unk> and our <unk>
And for <unk>  music brought us back to the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has brought him back to a family <unk> to a family of <unk> and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> it.
I'm going to make music with <unk>  whether we are at the <unk> <unk>  or in the <unk> <unk> because it <unk> my <unk>  Why I became a <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Thank you.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> I want to <unk> something that we've <unk> without <unk> from <unk>
So <unk> <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> for the next <unk>  is to try to <unk> the <unk> of the world in real life.  like the world <unk> in <unk> <unk>
Now, I have a plan for that, and I wanted to spend more time <unk> -- including the <unk> of the <unk> here, to <unk> more time <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now <unk> three billion hours per <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of you may be <unk>  <unk> a lot of time <unk> <unk>
Maybe too long time, <unk> in <unk>  how many problems we have to <unk> in the <unk> world.
<unk> to my <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> is exactly the <unk>
<unk> billion hours on the <unk> is not far enough for the game to solve the most <unk> problems in the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> on this <unk>  We have to <unk> this number of <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> that we need to <unk> <unk> billion <unk>
So, this is probably a little bit of <unk>
so I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to <unk>
If we want to <unk> problems like <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  I think we need to go to <unk> online online <unk>  <unk> I think we need to go to the <unk> of this <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here's the <unk> This picture <unk>  to <unk> why I think that <unk> are so <unk>  for the future of human human <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> made by a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
He wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk>
So it <unk> a room in front of the <unk> while they're <unk>
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, if you're not a <unk>  <unk> you might <unk> some of the <unk> of this <unk>
You probably <unk> the need for <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> for a very <unk> problems.
If you're a <unk> you're going to see a few <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it's <unk>
And the <unk> <unk> are a <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> which is about something called a <unk> <unk>
<unk> you've heard about that. OK.
So we have something <unk> among us.
A <unk> <unk> is a result that is so <unk> <unk> <unk>  You didn't think you can get it until you <unk>
It was almost beyond the <unk> <unk>
And when you get there, you're so <unk>  discover that you're really <unk> That's a <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is the face of the face that we need to see --  <unk> of people who are <unk> all over the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> against the <unk> is the way to get a <unk> <unk>
Now <unk> this is a face that we see more often  in the life that we see more often --  in life as we <unk> <unk>
This is what I call the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here are <unk> by doing this <unk> <unk> Can you <unk> Yeah.
This is actually me in the face of <unk> <unk>
Here's a piece of <unk> in my <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> where I got my <unk>  about the <unk> that we are better at games than in <unk> life.
And this is a problem that many <unk> a <unk>
We know that we're not as good as we are in <unk>
And I don't mean <unk> that in the <unk> <unk> even though this is a <unk>  We actually <unk> more in games than in real life, but when I say good and I mean <unk> to do something that <unk>  <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
And when we are in <unk> <unk>  I think many of us are becoming the best version of our most <unk> to help in a <unk> moment.  The most <unk> <unk> to <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> life, when we are <unk> to the <unk> when we are <unk> to the <unk> <unk> the most often <unk> we don't like this.
We <unk> our <unk>
We <unk> our <unk> can <unk> <unk> or <unk>
<unk> we don't have that kind of <unk> when we <unk>  They just have no <unk>
So that's what I wanted to <unk> when I <unk>
What is that is made of video is that there is nothing that we can't <unk>
How can we take these <unk> <unk> in video <unk> and <unk> them to the work in your life.
So I looked at games like <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is really a <unk> environment for <unk> <unk>
And I started to <unk> a few things  that make <unk> <unk> so <unk> in <unk> <unk>
So the first thing is that <unk> the <unk> <unk> in this video <unk>  <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But not any <unk> but a perfect <unk> <unk>  with your level of <unk> <unk>
So you can <unk> it to the <unk>
I never give you a <unk> that you can't <unk>
But this is at the <unk> of what you can <unk> So you have to get a lot of <unk>
But there is no <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There's always a very important thing to do.
And they're also <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> you <unk> hundreds of thousands of people are ready to work with you for <unk> <unk> your <unk>
It's not something that is possible with <unk> in your <unk> life.  this sense that in your <unk> are <unk>
And in <unk> it's also this <unk> story this story full of <unk>  about why we are there and what we're doing.
And then <unk> all this <unk> <unk>
You have heard of the growth and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We don't know that kind of <unk> <unk> in your life.
When I'm going to <unk> this <unk> I'm not going to have  <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They don't get that kind of <unk> in your life.
Now, the problem with the online <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk>  is that it's so <unk> to be <unk> something <unk> all the time in these <unk> <unk>
It's just better than <unk>
<unk> until now, in <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  spent <unk> million years <unk>  <unk> the <unk> problems of <unk>
Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing.
It could <unk> as a bad thing.
But to put that in the <unk>  <unk> million years ago, when our first <unk> human <unk> was <unk> in <unk>
<unk> was the first <unk> who <unk> in <unk>
Okay, so when we talk about how long long we get <unk>  <unk> <unk> the only way that it makes sense to think about it, it's going to talk about time to <unk> <unk>  So what is an <unk> thing.
But it is also <unk> Because it <unk>  that <unk> so long long <unk> <unk>  We're really changing what we are capable of doing as human <unk>
We <unk> to a <unk> species and more <unk>
This is true. I <unk>
So <unk> in <unk> this <unk> <unk>
It was recently <unk> by a <unk> at the University of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from a country with a powerful country with a <unk> <unk> <unk>  will have spent <unk> hours online <unk> to <unk>
Now, <unk> hours is a very interesting number of two <unk>
First of all, for children in the United States,  <unk> <unk> is the number of hours you're going to be going to be going to go to school  from <unk> <unk> if you never <unk> from the <unk>
So we have a whole <unk>  <unk> <unk> of <unk> which is going on <unk>  where people are learning as much about the rest of the <unk>
And some of you probably have read this new book of <unk> <unk> called <unk>
So, you're going to have heard about <unk> <unk>  <unk> theory of <unk>
It's based on <unk> <unk> research on the <unk> <unk> <unk>  that if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to any <unk>  until at the age of <unk> we're going to be <unk> on that <unk>
We're going to be as good as the largest <unk> in the world.
And so what we're looking at now -- and it's a whole <unk> of young people who are <unk> <unk>
So the big question is,  <unk> what do I get <unk> so <unk>
Because if we could figure out it,  we would have a <unk> human <unk> <unk>
So here is the <unk> people have now in the world --  that <unk> at least a day a day <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> are our <unk> <unk>
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the <unk> <unk>  we'll have another billion <unk>  that are <unk> <unk> at anything is this <unk>
If you don't know <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> energy and work on the basis of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  so that the <unk> all over the world  <unk> can <unk> <unk>
They <unk> another billion <unk> in <unk> <unk>
This will bring us to <unk> billion <unk>
So I started to think about what I'm doing is <unk>
These are the four things that we've <unk> The first is <unk> <unk>
Okay. Think about it as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> with <unk>  that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> always thought a <unk> <unk> is <unk> and it is always <unk>  and it's always worth now.
<unk> are not <unk>
<unk> are <unk> to <unk> a <unk> social <unk>
There are a lot of studies that look at the <unk> people more if you <unk> us a game with them, and even if we <unk> our <unk>
And the reason is that it's a lot of <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> that somebody will spend the time with us,  that it's going to be <unk> after the same <unk>  will <unk> the same <unk> and they will stay in the game by the <unk>
And so, I was working together with somebody really <unk> and <unk>
And as <unk> we build social <unk> more <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> this.
<unk> there is a reason why <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's because it <unk> when you <unk> a <unk>  that we are even <unk>  <unk> percent of <unk> than when we <unk> or when we <unk> with <unk>
We know that we are <unk> as human <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> are <unk> to work hard to work <unk>  <unk> if they're <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I love being <unk> by the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So just a little bit <unk> to help us see things in <unk>
So, you all know the biggest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk> with almost <unk> <unk> <unk>  is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> million people use it every <unk>
They <unk> more <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  through the Internet than any other <unk> <unk> in the world.
They <unk> a <unk> story.
They <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay, so we have this four <unk> <unk> that <unk> in a single thing.
<unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
These are people who think are <unk> to change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they are able to change the <unk> <unk>  but not the world of <unk>
This is the problem that I'm trying to <unk>
It's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>
His name is <unk> He <unk> why people were so long and energy and money in the <unk> <unk>
And he says, <unk> <unk> at what was <unk>  <unk> nothing less than a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> him is a <unk> So it's <unk>
And he <unk>  I am not like me -- I'm a <unk> of games and they're <unk>
But he says that this actually has a sense of <unk>  because the <unk> can get more in our <unk> than they can get <unk>
They can also have social <unk>  in games than in your life.
They get better <unk> and they feel <unk>  in games than in <unk> life.
So he says that now, it turns out that now, it's a way for <unk> to <unk> more time in the <unk> <unk> than the <unk>
Now, I agree that this is <unk> for <unk>
But it's not in any case, a <unk> <unk>
We need to start making the real world more than a <unk>
So I <unk> the <unk> of something that happened  <unk> years ago.
These are the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
I used to have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  I had <unk> <unk>
And these are the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're <unk> with your <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> you may know this story.
What is the history of <unk> who invented <unk> and <unk>
<unk> said that <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  have been <unk> in <unk> <unk>  in a moment of <unk>
<unk> was so a big <unk>  that the <unk> <unk> decided that he had to do something <unk>
People were <unk> People were <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk> They needed a <unk> <unk>
So <unk> to <unk> they invented <unk> <unk> <unk> and they <unk> a <unk> political <unk> in all the <unk>
One day, every one of them will <unk>
And the day <unk> everyone will <unk>
And it's going to be so <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  because the <unk> are so <unk> and we <unk> in a <unk> so <unk>  that they will not <unk>
And so the day of the <unk> <unk>  And one day <unk> will <unk>
And by the <unk> -- I lived so 18 years old,  <unk> one day and <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, this is the <unk> I think,  the way that we use <unk> today.
<unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world.
The <unk> <unk> to <unk> all of what is <unk>  in the environment that is not <unk> to our life and <unk> and <unk> what we need in <unk>
But it doesn't have to be there.
This is very interesting.
<unk> <unk> <unk> after 18 years <unk> was not <unk>
So <unk> decided that they would <unk> a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the entire <unk> in the <unk>
They <unk> a <unk> <unk>  and the <unk> got the <unk> to go into a <unk> <unk>
They will <unk> <unk>
And they will go to <unk> a new place where to <unk>  <unk> <unk> just like <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where they may be <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where they might <unk>
Now, that sounds <unk> isn't it?
But <unk> <unk> <unk> showed that <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  They had the same <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
And so <unk> have <unk>  that the <unk> story of <unk> could be <unk>
And the <unk> found the <unk> of a global <unk> that has <unk> <unk>  and that could explain <unk>
So, this <unk> story could be <unk>
They could actually have been able to <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk>  to go through the <unk> for 18 years and then it could be so <unk>  And then they could have been so much about how to <unk> through video games --
Okay, we can do that.
We <unk> our <unk> <unk>
<unk> was the first <unk> <unk> in real time  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> This was <unk> years ago.
They have <unk> video games for 18 years, and we <unk> <unk> for <unk> years.
I say that we are ready for our own <unk> <unk>
Now they had half a <unk> who went to <unk> a <unk> world.
So, from here to me the <unk> billion hours of game on the <unk>
We want to <unk> to <unk> half of us to <unk> half of us to <unk> half an hour per day on video <unk>  until we <unk> problems <unk>
Now I know that <unk> you <unk> <unk> we can solve the problems of your <unk>  in <unk> Well, this is the <unk> <unk> I've been <unk> my work in the last few years,   <unk> <unk> for <unk>
We have this <unk> to our <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> our <unk> of how to try to <unk> with <unk>
We don't want to try to <unk> <unk>
What we want to do is <unk> <unk>
We were trying to <unk> our best <unk>
And then we want to <unk> people to <unk> this <unk> in <unk>
We want to <unk> our <unk> <unk>  and then give people the <unk> to <unk> these <unk> <unk>
So I want to show you very quickly three of the <unk> that we've done is trying to <unk> people the <unk>  to create <unk> <unk> in their <unk>
So, this is the world of <unk>
We created this game in <unk>
This is a <unk> game where you're trying to <unk>  a <unk> <unk>
The amount of oil is <unk> but we put enough <unk> in there and so that you can think it's <unk> and <unk> your life --  as if you <unk> have a <unk> So when you go into this <unk>  <unk> <unk> you tell us where you <unk>
And then you <unk> your <unk> video <unk> in real time  <unk> of data that shows you exactly how much it costs <unk> <unk>  What is not <unk> how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  So if the <unk> are <unk>
And you have to tell you how you <unk> your life <unk>  And then if all of this would be <unk> And then you <unk> to <unk> in a <unk> about it,  to <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I <unk> this game in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
And we asked them three years since <unk>
And I can tell you that it's an experience that <unk> you.
<unk> wants to <unk> their <unk> <unk>  because it's only good for the world, or because that's <unk>
But if you <unk> them in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a story and a <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> you to see how you <unk>
Most of our <unk> have learned in this <unk>
So, for the future that we can <unk> the world that can <unk> the world to the more <unk> than the lack of <unk>
<unk> created a game called <unk> for <unk>
And the <unk> was that a <unk> <unk>  that people have only <unk> years of spent on this planet.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> people to come online to come to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
You have <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and they all all have something to do to <unk> the world.
But in our <unk> instead of having only five people five <unk>  in this team of <unk> I said that all of us are part of the <unk> <unk> and the future to <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it's the future of <unk> and the future of <unk> <unk>
<unk> had <unk> people who have <unk> this game for eight <unk>
They invented 500 <unk> <unk> that you can see if <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So in <unk> the last game  <unk> <unk> it in three <unk> This is a <unk> game with <unk> <unk> <unk>  If you can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  If you can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> from all over Africa <unk>  And they asked them to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk> We have <unk> <unk> in <unk>  at the <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the ability to be <unk> full of <unk>
I'd like to <unk> all of you to <unk> to all of you to <unk> this game with people -- especially in the development areas that could be <unk> out of <unk>  that might <unk> from <unk> to <unk> their own social <unk> that would <unk>
So, now I'm going to <unk>
I want to ask you something.
What do you think is going to happen now <unk>
We all have these <unk> <unk>  We have these games that are a kind of <unk> <unk> of what we might <unk>  but no one of them has <unk>
And I hope that you will agree with me that <unk> are a human <unk>  that we can use to <unk> for the <unk> world,  that <unk> are a <unk> <unk>
We all have these <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> the ability to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to make a <unk> <unk>
I hope we can <unk> that we can <unk> us to <unk> <unk> that <unk> to <unk> on this planet for another <unk>
And it's my <unk> that you're going to <unk> you to <unk> and <unk> games like <unk>
When I think about <unk> <unk> I know two things certainly <unk>  that we can create any <unk> <unk> <unk> and that we can <unk> any <unk> <unk>
So I say, <unk> that change the world.
Thank you.
For some time I am interested in the <unk>  -- which would seem <unk>     -- just if you think about it as I think about it, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>  I thought by someone --  becomes a <unk> thing <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
For example, if it was a <unk> <unk> in the body is a <unk> <unk> <unk>  called <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is becoming a <unk>  It's because of the <unk> where someone <unk> it.
In order to get <unk>  I want to start by showing you a <unk> <unk>  a very simple <unk>
And I'm going to show you how it <unk> This is a <unk>  that I <unk> every book of <unk> for children in <unk>
And I learned from <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> I'm going to show you and then <unk> it.
And then I'll explain why we <unk>
So, here's what happens.
The <unk> that you can <unk> your hand for my <unk> you can <unk>
<unk> <unk> like this.
I'm going to <unk> <unk>
And to <unk> you that nothing is <unk> or not <unk> out of my <unk>  I'm going to <unk> this <unk>
So to see that nothing <unk> on here.
<unk> as long as I was sitting there and nothing comes out there and nothing comes out of my <unk>
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to <unk> <unk>  and <unk> if you <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, it's so <unk>  that I can <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> not <unk>
We don't know anything to <unk> or <unk> <unk> And you can <unk> the <unk>
<unk>
The <unk> <unk> kids <unk> that <unk> to <unk> <unk> because you can <unk>  a lot about <unk> <unk> <unk>  even if it's very simple to do.
Most of you here <unk> <unk>
Here's what happens.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say I'm going to <unk> my hand <unk>  to imagine that there is no <unk> on there,  is a <unk>
The reason I'm <unk> me <unk>  is actually the <unk> of this <unk>
At the moment my hand is <unk> in front of the <unk>  and not a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk>  where it is to a <unk>  of the kind of <unk>
<unk>
<unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
So this is how it works.
And as I <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we can <unk> why don't you <unk> this in the <unk>  Why don't you think they're just three <unk> here, but because it <unk> and the way it <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not <unk> it? And then <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> out there, not by <unk>  but by a <unk>  but by a <unk> <unk>
And then when the <unk> <unk> the same thing,  as I was <unk> <unk>  <unk> in a kind of <unk> my <unk>
I give my hand to a <unk> And I <unk>
This <unk> you can make it <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Now,  which is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I read a <unk> a year ago, I read my <unk>
I'm not <unk> <unk> so for me  This was something <unk>
It turns out that if you <unk>  a <unk> <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> --  just a <unk> <unk> it has a certain <unk> <unk>
But if you look at the shape of the <unk> in which <unk> a <unk>  You make it <unk> and <unk> it a <unk> <unk>
<unk> no one of these <unk>  They don't have <unk> <unk> -- they're <unk> with <unk>
But <unk> <unk> is not as good as the <unk>
<unk>  That left me <unk>
And yet it turns out that it's not <unk> here.
If you take <unk>  I'm more <unk> than <unk> any <unk>
A <unk> <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> to the other <unk>  is better <unk> <unk> <unk>
And with <unk> is a <unk>
A <unk> twice a day --  -- it's not as good as a <unk>  I don't remember <unk>
But the idea is <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And by the shape has something to do with that.
And if you want the <unk> <unk> you have to <unk> <unk>
<unk> A <unk> with something <unk>  some <unk> <unk> <unk> by something <unk>  and <unk> that in a <unk>
So it's such a powerful picture for them,  much more powerful than the <unk> <unk>
It is <unk> <unk> <unk> well, I'll show you the <unk> you will have <unk>
The point is that  <unk> <unk> is not as good as the <unk> <unk>  it's not as good as a <unk> and it's not as good as a <unk>
And there's no <unk> quality <unk>
It only <unk> our <unk> it <unk> to our <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And I wanted to see if I can <unk> this idea to a <unk> <unk>
And take something that is obviously a <unk> <unk>  and make it <unk> <unk>
And we know from that study --  that if you want to <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> seven <unk> It's very <unk>
And I'll call it <unk>
This is my <unk> There's no <unk>
This is my <unk> It's not a <unk> <unk>
I'm going to <unk> my <unk> and I'm going to <unk> with this <unk>
If you're <unk>  if you <unk> with <unk> -- I was doing this for some friends --  in the <unk> room, <unk> and there were some people that didn't <unk>  and a woman who was almost <unk>
So, I <unk> you that if you get <unk> <unk> <unk>  In fact, <unk> you know <unk>  In fact, you know <unk> I'm not going to be the first part of the <unk>
You're going to see, you're going to look at the other side if you <unk>
So, this is right here,  On the right side of my <unk> I'm going to make a little <unk>
It seems <unk> <unk> You <unk>
And now they go through the <unk> <unk> and <unk> it on the other side side like this.
Now, we are pretty much at the same point in the same point that we are about <unk>
This is something like that.
But now you can't <unk> my <unk>
<unk> let's say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, <unk>
I know what people think when I see that.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What does that look <unk> <unk>
Yeah, <unk>  And the <unk>  And the people in the <unk> will say, <unk> In fact, we've never seen the <unk>  The <unk> in the <unk> start to <unk>
Let me show you better.
That's my <unk> It's not my <unk> <unk>
This is my <unk> and I can <unk>
<unk> <unk> If it's <unk> <unk> <unk> in the other hand,  I don't think about that.
And the people in the <unk> or the people who are going to look at the <unk>  <unk> it looks pretty <unk>  is a <unk> there, but if it was <unk> it was a <unk> there, but if it has a <unk> there and another if it was <unk> there and another if it was a <unk> there and another <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> now I would <unk> <unk>
<unk> your hand and your hand <unk> that I have no <unk>
But I think that in this <unk>  and the idea of taking something <unk> and turn it into something <unk>  and transform it into something <unk>  I'll leave it in there, and I'm going to get it out of the <unk>
We see a few times <unk>
I hope that I hope you have a lot.
So I met a lot of <unk> at my life.
I just <unk> <unk>
The first one was  more like a <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>  full of <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>  A <unk> <unk>
What do you <unk>
Even better, but it was raised to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So you could feel good when you <unk> it.
I was in a <unk> with this <unk> on the <unk> of many <unk>
One day, <unk> <unk> me <unk>  and asked me if I talk to a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk>
So here is a company to <unk> what has become this <unk> problem for our <unk> <unk>
How to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And for the last 50 years,  I've been <unk> in <unk> and <unk>  as we <unk> <unk>
It's hard to <unk>
<unk> percent of the big <unk> that you <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  all <unk>
<unk> they <unk>
So <unk> or <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> become part of our <unk> are becoming part of our <unk>
There are a lot of <unk> about <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> at least most their <unk> a <unk>  and they <unk> the <unk> you see the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
That means that you need 15 <unk> <unk> <unk>  to get a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not very <unk>
And <unk> has no <unk> too <unk>
So <unk> in <unk>  It was a company that was trying to do well.
I wanted to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  I <unk> the public <unk> in <unk>
We call <unk>
<unk> I said, <unk> you to put things on the <unk> you're <unk>  because you're <unk> so far out of the <unk> so far out of the <unk> that you're not <unk>
<unk> he <unk> he <unk> so far in the <unk>  that <unk> from our <unk> are <unk>  that we are not <unk>
And then he <unk>  <unk> in fact, a new world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> I <unk> I <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> I was <unk> in <unk> and I <unk>  What is a <unk> <unk>
So the second day, even before I <unk> <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> some examples of <unk> <unk> <unk>  He said that he was not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Well, I talked to the phone with some people in the <unk>
No one could give me a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I was talking to <unk> <unk>
We also call it <unk>
<unk> I said, <unk> some examples of <unk> <unk>  Well, he <unk> some <unk>  Well, he <unk> some <unk>  And then he said <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
I said, <unk>  from your <unk> is <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is about 30 to <unk> he <unk>
<unk> what is <unk> in <unk>  <unk> <unk> with <unk> I <unk>
It was a long <unk> on the <unk> and he said, <unk> it's just too many <unk> <unk>
My <unk> for this <unk> was <unk>
No, not because I would be a <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It actually <unk>
No, I felt <unk> by this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The second <unk> is a different kind of <unk>
It's the kind of <unk> --  -- the kind of <unk> the more you <unk>  the more you <unk>
We <unk> it to a <unk>  in <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> for a long <unk> about this <unk>
In a kind of <unk> <unk>
It came to <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> almost <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> him too much.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> was <unk>
Who can make a <unk> to have the good <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't <unk> but this <unk> <unk>
We call <unk>
In fact, his name is really <unk>
And no, he's not <unk> <unk> and he's not <unk> <unk>
At least not as you and I understand that.
This is a <unk>  <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the <unk>  <unk> was in the <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> in the area that was actually a <unk>
They created by <unk> <unk>
They built this series of <unk> <unk> and they <unk> the water outside the <unk>
But they weren't able to get to <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was a <unk>
<unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> -- which for this <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk>
So in <unk>  a <unk> company with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What do they <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> <unk>
They <unk> to <unk>
<unk> of <unk> water <unk>  They used <unk> to bring the water <unk>
They have <unk> <unk>
They created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- and in this <unk> process and his company has completely <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
I mean, you've never seen something <unk>
You look at the <unk>  which is about millions of <unk> <unk> and what you see are <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I was there was no <unk> <unk>
He's a <unk> <unk>  three parts of the <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> <unk> there <unk> <unk> <unk> and I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here he shows a <unk> <unk>
Now <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
And here he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk>  that <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We found out that <unk> spent most of the <unk> <unk> in Africa.
We asked him how it became  like <unk> in <unk>
He said, <unk> I didn't know anything about <unk>
I am <unk> in <unk>
And then it <unk> in a number of <unk>  about <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And not <unk> me was <unk> you know, a kind of <unk> community in <unk>
It was <unk> but I was <unk>
And I was <unk> after that piece of <unk> <unk>  <unk> too much, that I <unk> in <unk> <unk>
So I said, <unk> I said, <unk>  <unk> what your <unk> <unk> to be so <unk>
He showed up to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> is <unk>
But what do you <unk> <unk>
What is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, it started to tell me --  that it's such a <unk> system.  that <unk> <unk> what would be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so <unk>  <unk> <unk> completely <unk>
There is no other <unk>
Have you ever heard of a <unk> that doesn't <unk> their <unk>
<unk> that day, <unk> <unk> through this <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and I said, <unk> a place that seems so <unk>  <unk> any other <unk> that I've been <unk>  <unk> any other <unk> that I have been <unk>  <unk> <unk> I will <unk>
At that point, it was like <unk> <unk> a movie would be <unk>
And we've <unk> <unk> and we've seen the most amazing <unk> <unk>  thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> to their <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
<unk> I was completely <unk>
I said, <unk> but they're not <unk> from <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> 20 percent of our <unk> and <unk> <unk> because of <unk>
Well, the last year, this <unk>  had <unk> <unk> on it,  more than <unk> different species of <unk>
<unk> has become the largest <unk> and one of the most important <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> from all the <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>  is not the last thing you want on a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> no.
He said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
So the more <unk> is <unk>  the <unk> the more <unk>
In <unk> to <unk>
A <unk> that doesn't <unk> their <unk>  and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> but also a <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> those <unk>  You don't even have to be there.
They were <unk> in a city to <unk> <unk> <unk>  where the <unk> are better to <unk> their <unk>
Every <unk> they <unk>  <unk> <unk> to <unk>
And every <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They do it because they're able to <unk>  The <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not a <unk>
It <unk> me something like <unk> <unk>  So I looked at the <unk>
I said, <unk> her <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and then she <unk>  <unk> <unk> back <unk>
<unk> it for <unk> <unk>
He looked at me like I would be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
He <unk> <unk> I do it because <unk> is <unk>
I have no <unk> my <unk> <unk>  which was <unk> and I didn't like <unk> <unk>
I don't like <unk> I don't like that.
It has that <unk> <unk> as <unk>
When I give you a little bit of about every <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> to that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk>  as if you were <unk> a <unk> <unk>
I <unk> this <unk> <unk> and <unk>
He said, <unk> like a <unk>
It's the last <unk> of anything that <unk> <unk>
It evolved to <unk> <unk>
And then it <unk>  <unk> our water doesn't have <unk>
In <unk> A <unk> that doesn't <unk> their <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I understood when he said when he said, <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>  because the water <unk>  because the water <unk>  because the water <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> that brings up with this --  -- all the things that you <unk> <unk> to bring in these days,  <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when it <unk> their way through the system and <unk> it.  and the water is more <unk> than the <unk>
<unk> is so <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, not only a <unk> that doesn't <unk> their <unk>  not only a <unk> who <unk> their <unk>  through the <unk> <unk> <unk> but also a <unk> <unk> which is actually a <unk> <unk> <unk> and not only for those <unk> but for you and for me <unk>
Because when the water <unk> it <unk> into the <unk> <unk>
I have a <unk> in <unk> <unk>  but I take it into the <unk> and that's what you should do, and you know, because this story of <unk>                         -- because it's <unk> is <unk>
You might say it's a <unk>  for the future of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> no matter that we're talking about <unk> or <unk>
What we need now is a <unk> <unk> a new <unk> of <unk>  one in which <unk> really has good <unk>
But for a lot of people  This is a little too <unk>
We are not <unk>
We are <unk>
We <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk> <unk>
We talk about <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk>
And when you think that these are things --  that will <unk> the future of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and I love <unk> <unk> <unk> but how are you going to <unk> <unk>
How are you going to <unk>
They can be <unk>
I love that <unk>
No, it's not because we already <unk>  more <unk> than it takes for the world.
One billion people are going to be <unk> today.
A billion -- this is more than <unk> before --  because of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  not because of the <unk>
Now, I don't like this question because it <unk>  <unk> our system in the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and all the <unk> <unk>  <unk> and all the <unk>  <unk> <unk> can be if you <unk>  <unk> more people with <unk> <unk>
This was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
We should call it <unk>  a <unk> in the <unk>  a <unk> very quickly <unk>  <unk> <unk> that makes that <unk> <unk>
This is not a <unk> and it's not <unk>
Our <unk> of <unk> is <unk> today,  <unk> not because of the <unk> in the <unk>  but because of the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> or the <unk>  but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk> <unk> not by the <unk> but by the <unk> <unk> <unk> not by the <unk> but <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> How are we going to <unk> our <unk>
Or better, how can we create <unk>  that allow <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
In order to do that,  not <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the future.
It's very old and it's <unk>
It takes a lot of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and not has ever <unk>
<unk> of that, look at the <unk> <unk>
This is the one that is based on billions of years.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> like <unk>  <unk> that are not <unk> only for them <unk>  <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk>  <unk> that <unk> instead of <unk>  <unk> <unk> that are not just <unk>  but <unk> <unk> that are not only <unk>  but because they are the people who are and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk>
And if I want to be really <unk>  They are <unk> <unk> better than I <unk>
<unk> me with that,  because if this is the future <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the end of the <unk> I was <unk> at school and one day.
And I was always <unk> by a <unk>  a <unk> book --  -- what I call my mind to other <unk> and I <unk>
And -- you know that <unk> <unk> is also the fact that <unk> were not at the <unk>  I was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I was a real <unk> in <unk>
But everything had to do with my <unk> to understand the world,  to understand the <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> for <unk>  even seemed to be <unk> in the world around me --  because what was going to happen in the <unk> 60 percent --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk>  with <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> us.  animals and places out of a <unk> world --  that we've never been able to <unk> the <unk> before.
So that looked like <unk>  with the whole part of the <unk>
And I was a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I discovered that, because I didn't video video video video <unk> and <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> and all this  <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>  I had to create these <unk> <unk> in my <unk>
We all <unk> to <unk> as kids have to <unk> to <unk> a book and through the <unk> <unk>  to put a book through the <unk> <unk> in our <unk>
And so my answer to all that was to <unk> to <unk>  <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of these things.
I was always <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that was because this <unk>  had to <unk> their <unk> a way of <unk>
And it happened to be <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>  made me very <unk> about the fact that there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> right here on the <unk>
I could not really go into a <unk> world <unk>  in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> seemed pretty <unk>
But that was a world that I could really <unk> <unk>  here, on the <unk> and this was the same <unk> and <unk>  like anything else that I <unk> my <unk>  <unk> those <unk>
So I decided that I would become a <unk>  at the age of <unk>
And the only problem with this was that I was <unk> in a little <unk> in the <unk>  at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I did not let me <unk>
I <unk> my father until he <unk> to <unk> <unk>  a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> New York <unk> <unk>  <unk> right next to almost where we <unk>
And I really became <unk> <unk>  in a <unk> in <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in the middle of the <unk>  in <unk> New <unk>
And we haven't seen a <unk> <unk>  for two years, when we moved to <unk>
<unk> then, over the course of the last 40 years --  I spent about <unk> hours under the water and 500 of those hours were in the <unk>
And I learned that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and even <unk> less <unk>  I'm so <unk> <unk>  I'm so <unk> by what we can <unk>
<unk> <unk> is so <unk> <unk> <unk>  in <unk> with our <unk>  in <unk> with our human <unk>
I am completely <unk>  — what I see when I do these <unk>
And my <unk> story with <unk> <unk> and it's as powerful as it was <unk>
But when I <unk> a <unk> like <unk>  That's what I was <unk>
And that <unk> to be the best way to <unk>  And this needs to be <unk>  that I had to tell stories  with the need to create <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
So <unk> <unk> was the way to put the <unk> and the <unk> together. And that had <unk>
And of course, the <unk> that we <unk> to tell them about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And with <unk> I <unk> my <unk>  for <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
So this is the two <unk>
The interesting interesting thing is from the <unk>  and that is the <unk> of the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> and that is creating this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this has led to the first <unk>  that has ever <unk> in a <unk>
And even though the film did not make money,  I should say that she was only <unk> her <unk>  I was <unk> to something <unk> and that is that <unk>  <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that any technology <unk> is impossible to <unk> <unk>
They <unk> something <unk>
And this is what it made me really <unk>
And I thought, <unk> this is something that has to be <unk>  in <unk> <unk>
That's why in <unk> <unk> who was the next <unk> which was my next <unk>  I took this much <unk>
<unk> with <unk> we created on the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  of that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  how this <unk> <unk>
And he <unk> And we created again <unk>
And we had the same <unk> <unk>
We also made more money on the <unk>
So <unk> a line between these two  <unk> of the fact that this is going to be a completely <unk> world.  a new form of <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put a <unk> companies with <unk> <unk> <unk>  My friend <unk> <unk>  which is <unk> by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to that <unk> and I <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And the idea behind the <unk> was --  <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and so on.
And we actually did that, what gave us a <unk> <unk> for a <unk>
But I was <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  what I was looking at the design of the <unk> and it <unk> in fact, the company <unk>
And I wrote this piece called <unk>  -- that had <unk> the role of <unk> things that were <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was going to be completely <unk> in the <unk>
And the world would be <unk>
<unk> don't have <unk>
And people from my company said to me,  that we're not going to be able to do it for a <unk>
So we put the idea of <unk> and we made another film about a big <unk> that <unk>
<unk> we went and <unk> to <unk> as <unk> and <unk> on a <unk>
We want to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> what I wanted to do was to <unk> me to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
And that's why we did <unk>
This is <unk> Well, you don't know that.
But we <unk> them. We said, <unk> we will <unk> <unk> we will <unk> <unk>
We're going to use that in the beginning of the <unk>
It will be very important. It's going to be a <unk> point for <unk>
And we asked them to <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> But it has to do with <unk> that --  that your <unk> can create a <unk>
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,  <unk> me in a <unk> <unk>  -- two <unk> and a half <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, that <unk> me.
And it took a lot of <unk> we had to build <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of things like this.  But it <unk> me how much like  But I <unk> this <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk>  But it was <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> where everything was <unk> <unk> and that was <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in this <unk> you get to this <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> where there is no <unk> to be <unk>  if you can't go back <unk>
And I <unk> <unk> I live in a <unk> <unk>
This is really <unk>
And so we've really been <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course, <unk> of <unk> they <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk> It was <unk>
And it was a experience that  <unk> couldn't <unk>
Because you know, I could <unk> my <unk> and I could make an <unk> effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was <unk>  through that <unk>
So while I was doing some of the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> things that we haven't seen <unk>  <unk> that nobody has seen seen the <unk>  <unk> that nobody has seen the <unk>  -- that were not <unk> of science --  -- at the time that we were <unk> and <unk>
So I was completely <unk> about this and I had to be more.
So I took a pretty <unk> <unk>
After the <unk> <unk>  I said, <unk> a <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it to be <unk> with the <unk> for a <unk>
And so we started to <unk> these  <unk>
And we got to go to <unk> and <unk> it with the <unk> <unk>
We went back to <unk> <unk>
We took little <unk> that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the idea was to get <unk> and to make a <unk> <unk> of what has been done before.
No one looked at <unk> They didn't have the <unk> to do that,  And so we created the technology to do that.
So you know, <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> a lot like the one that we knew <unk> <unk>
And you get a little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I say, <unk> <unk> but my mind is in that <unk>
I felt like I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was the most <unk> in <unk>  <unk> experience that we <unk> <unk> <unk>  because we knew before a <unk> <unk> a <unk>  which is going to be there, as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   So I was going to <unk> him for <unk> years of when he <unk> the <unk>
And the <unk> was <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This was an <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it made me really <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can have these <unk> <unk> <unk>  when your <unk> is <unk> in a <unk>  in this other form of <unk>
It was a great thing.
And maybe a look at what could happen  a few <unk> of what could happen to have the body <unk>  <unk> as we start to have body body body <unk>  for <unk> or for <unk> <unk>  -- in many of the <unk>  that I can imagine  like the <unk> <unk>
So by doing these <unk> and <unk> to really <unk> what we found out there,  like these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  where we found these <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are in <unk> <unk> who live here, on the <unk>
They live in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  They don't <unk> in a system like us.
So you see animals that live next to  <unk> of water <unk>
You think you might not <unk>
At the same time  I was very interested in science <unk>  Again, the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk>
And I <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> the community <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And all these things, and to really go to the <unk> <unk>  with our <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that was <unk>
But what I got to do is get to make is to bring <unk> <unk> to <unk>  with us in <unk>
And to get them down so that they can have <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  people who were <unk> by these <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and take the <unk> to <unk> <unk> and so on.
So you're doing <unk> <unk>  but in fact, <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I was completely <unk>  of being a <unk> <unk>  You know, like <unk> and doing things on the <unk>  And you know, over this <unk>  And you know, over this <unk>  And I learned over this <unk>  And I learned a very <unk>
I learned a lot about <unk> But I also learned a lot about <unk> <unk>
Now, you think that <unk> has to be a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these things.
I didn't really learn about the art art art of <unk> to lead to <unk>  until we haven't made these <unk>
Because he went back to a <unk> <unk> to say <unk>  <unk> I do <unk>
Why do I do that? What do they <unk>
We don't make money with these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> They don't bring any <unk> <unk>
<unk> I think that I went to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and I was doing my <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We did all of these <unk> I did all of these <unk>  for a very <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You do it for the work in the <unk>  — and the <unk> is the most <unk> environment that <unk>  <unk> for <unk> <unk> and for the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we were doing these things with a team of <unk> people,  <unk> years.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in this <unk> <unk>  that the most important thing --  is the <unk> you have for them and they have for you, that you made a <unk>  that you can't explain <unk>
When you think about <unk> and you say  <unk> we had to do that, and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to work <unk>  You cannot explain to people's <unk> It is that thing that  You can't <unk> <unk> it all over and <unk> and I know that <unk> can be <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So when I went back to make my next <unk>  which was <unk>  I tried to <unk> the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and that is to <unk> your team and <unk> them at the same time and the <unk>
And it really changed the <unk>
<unk> again with a little <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> technology -- that was not right now.
<unk> interesting.
<unk> <unk>
And I became a <unk> over a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>
And that really changed my way to do <unk>
So people have <unk> <unk> <unk> in which well, you know, you have brought to life <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet.
For me, it was more a <unk> way to make <unk>  the process of making the <unk> of this <unk>
So, what can we <unk>
<unk> what are the <unk> <unk>
<unk> I think the first one is  <unk>
It's the most powerful thing you <unk>
<unk> is a <unk>  that you can actually <unk> in a <unk>
And the <unk> of your <unk>  is more important than  all the <unk> in the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk>  come to me and say, <unk> a <unk> to make <unk>
And I say, "I don't <unk> <unk>
<unk> people are going to do it for you not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk>
<unk> has this <unk>  <unk> is not a <unk>
But <unk> has to be a <unk>  in art and <unk> because it's a <unk> <unk>
And no important <unk>  that <unk> asked the <unk>  which was not <unk>
You have to be <unk> to <unk> those <unk>
So this is the <unk> that I <unk> you <unk>  which is that any <unk>  <unk> <unk> a <unk>  but <unk> <unk> Thank you.
I would leave with a single important idea today, and that the whole amount of data -- and that the whole amount of data that you <unk>  And instead of <unk> you think about the way that we can see the <unk> <unk>  and we can see the <unk> of the <unk> so that we can see the <unk> that would be <unk>
Now we look at a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> after the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> that I use here is <unk> to be called <unk> and what I can do with it is that I can <unk> a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> for example.
I see how a different <unk> <unk>
This <unk> here in the <unk>  people are at their most <unk> <unk>  and here because they become very <unk>
We <unk> a step back and <unk> and <unk> the data after the <unk>  We see that <unk> <unk> and cancer is <unk> but not for <unk>
If you <unk> and <unk> after the <unk>  to <unk> 40 years or <unk>  We see that <unk> are actually the <unk> <unk> that <unk> to <unk> them.
And <unk> it's particularly the case for <unk>
I know that --  this kind of <unk> of <unk> <unk>  is like <unk>  in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if we can do this simple data <unk>  Why don't we do the same with <unk>
So here we have  <unk> <unk> number of <unk> <unk>  that has been <unk>
They are all here. They are all <unk>
You can <unk> this home when you go from here.
With <unk> you can <unk> some <unk>
And then I was <unk>
You can go directly to a certain <unk>
I look at this -- I see the <unk>  that came up in this <unk> <unk>
I'm a big <unk> <unk> <unk> so I <unk> it.  and that brings me to all the <unk>  where the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So if I just look at them,  I can just look on them,  <unk> I would have to see what they have about <unk> in the <unk>
I come back and <unk> that.
I see <unk> <unk> now.
And you think that when you <unk>  through the <unk> like <unk>  <unk> when you get <unk>  <unk> you go before you <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> something a little bit <unk>
It's somewhere in <unk> and we think it's changing the way that you can be used <unk>
I want to go a little bit more on this <unk>  which is a little bit <unk>
I took every <unk> in the <unk> and I <unk> to a <unk>
<unk> is just a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that we <unk>
I'm just going to show you the first 500 <unk> <unk> right here.
But even in <unk> <unk>  We can do a lot of things.
<unk> we see what are the <unk> <unk>  The <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
Now I'm going to <unk> <unk>
Now that I <unk> the <unk>  I can see the <unk> in the <unk>  that <unk> the most <unk>  which is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is important because it's a <unk> thing that was not <unk> in any <unk> <unk>
You can discover this  You only take a step back and look at all the <unk>
<unk> all of these <unk> <unk>  I can then <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> <unk> to bring all the <unk>
And I look at these <unk>  I see that most come from the <unk>
<unk> come from <unk> <unk>
<unk> and more <unk> come from the <unk>
Here's my <unk>
And this comes from <unk>
And pretty <unk>  <unk> is also a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we go to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> for the first time I was <unk> to be really a <unk> and not from the <unk> in the <unk>  but in the <unk> level of <unk>
And I want to show you one thing about a <unk>  that can take you through the <unk>
I'm going to show you New York <unk>
<unk> our <unk> --  I don't want to call it <unk> because it's not a <unk> but you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> with it -- and the technology of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I can make a <unk> <unk>  to go back to a certain <unk>
Why is it important, because just <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way,  I can see my entire history of <unk>  in the same way.
I can <unk> to <unk> what I did  in different <unk>
Here's the <unk> of this <unk> that we are doing now.
And I can look at the things that we've done today <unk>
And if I want to take a step back and look at the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> for example.
Here I <unk>  <unk> <unk> here for <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so I can <unk> a <unk> and <unk> it again.
It's a <unk> <unk> more than <unk> and every case it does the entire <unk> the entire <unk> <unk>
Now, in our world, but we think that data is a <unk> for us.
We <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
We think we are <unk> in <unk>
So what if we <unk> it all <unk>  and we go back and <unk> <unk>  So instead of going from one thing to the <unk>  So we're going to be able to find the <unk>  that are <unk>
If we could do that, instead of being <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  we could actually <unk> the <unk>
And instead of having a <unk> <unk> with the <unk>  We could actually <unk> the <unk>
And if the <unk> <unk> maybe it's also <unk> <unk>
With that, thank you.
Everybody talks about <unk> today.
I <unk> someone to <unk> how many <unk>  that have the word <unk> in <unk> have been <unk> in the last five years and <unk> and <unk> after about <unk> I am much more <unk>
There is a <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
It's been a lot of <unk> for <unk> <unk>
Everybody would like to make people more <unk>
<unk> despite the <unk> of <unk> in this <unk>  There are a few <unk> <unk>  that <unk> us to make a <unk> <unk> <unk>  about <unk>
My <unk> today is going to make <unk> <unk> to these <unk> <unk>
And they are <unk> to the <unk> people who think about <unk> <unk>  how much and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  It seems like all <unk>
The first one of these <unk>  is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
It turns out that <unk> <unk>  It's not a <unk> word because because we use it to too many different things.
<unk> there is a <unk> <unk> that we might <unk> it, but in <unk> <unk>  <unk> you will have to <unk> this <unk> and <unk> a more <unk> vision 
The second <unk> is a <unk> between the experience and <unk>  In fact, a <unk> between being <unk> in life and being <unk> in your <unk> or being <unk> in your life.
There are two different <unk>  <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
And the third <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>  the fact that we can't think of any <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- without <unk> them.
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just not <unk> <unk>
I would like to start with the <unk> of a person who during a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> at the end of a <unk> <unk>
I thought I was <unk> a <unk> and that music was absolutely <unk>
But at the end of the <unk>  has been heard a <unk> <unk>  and it was pretty <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, it's not <unk>  but <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> 20 minutes of music <unk>
But they were <unk> to <unk>  because what was <unk> was <unk>
<unk> had been <unk> and the <unk> was the whole thing that was <unk>
<unk> here is --  that we probably <unk> us on and <unk>  like <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
There is a <unk> at the moment of <unk>  that <unk> in the <unk>  and the <unk> <unk>  but in <unk> has only <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> when you <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> when you <unk>
On the other side of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is the one that <unk> the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of our life.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  when you <unk>  <unk> I felt in the last <unk>
or <unk> was <unk> in <unk> <unk>
These two are <unk> very different <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  And the <unk> between them goes to the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  is a <unk>
<unk> with the <unk> <unk> of our <unk> --  starts <unk>
We're not just saying <unk> when we <unk> <unk>
Our <unk> tells us the <unk>  <unk> what we <unk> to <unk> from our <unk>  is a story.
Let me start with an example.
There is a <unk> study of <unk> that go through a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't <unk> in the <unk> It's not <unk> today, but it was <unk> during the <unk>
The <unk> were asked to describe the <unk> every 60 <unk>
We have two <unk> and their <unk>
The question <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a very <unk> question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
His <unk> has <unk> more than that,  went through every <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> even more than that.
But here's another <unk>  <unk> <unk> have <unk> these <unk> <unk>
And this is where we have a <unk>  <unk> is that <unk> He has a much more <unk> about <unk>  than the <unk>
The <unk> of these <unk> have been different  because an <unk> part of the <unk> is how they <unk>
<unk> of the <unk> is not <unk> or <unk>  <unk> one of them --  -- but one of them is obviously <unk> more <unk> than <unk>
And the most <unk>  was where the <unk> was more <unk> to the <unk>
It's a <unk> story.
How do you <unk>
I asked these people after the <unk>  — how <unk> <unk> was <unk> in <unk>
In their <unk> it was much more <unk> for the <unk> It was much more <unk> for <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>  between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
From a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we could do with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we actually made <unk> <unk>  that have <unk> <unk>  that have <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> without <unk> it too much.
This is going to make the <unk>  <unk> but it <unk>  <unk> much less than ever before.
If we do that about two minutes --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> but <unk> the one <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> because I just left him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What is a <unk> <unk>
And it's <unk> for the <unk> that we <unk> <unk> <unk> but also for the <unk> that we <unk>
What <unk> a story are <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> is very, very important.
In this case, the end was <unk>
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> life.
It has <unk> <unk> <unk> and you <unk> What happens to these <unk>
And the answer is very <unk>
They are <unk> for <unk>
Most of the life of life --  and I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What it means is that in a life --  We have about <unk> million of these <unk>
In a <unk> we have about <unk>
Most of the <unk> no <unk>
Most of them are completely <unk>  <unk> <unk>
And yet, we have <unk>  that we should <unk> <unk>  that what is happening in these <unk> <unk> of <unk> is our life.
It's the <unk> <unk> that I <unk>  during our <unk> on the <unk>
And the way a <unk>  should be <unk> but this is not the story of the <unk> <unk> a <unk>
So we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  what are the <unk>
The biggest <unk> of them is --  the way that is <unk> time.
From the point of <unk> <unk>  if you <unk> in the <unk>  and the second <unk> is as good as a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
For <unk> <unk> things are not working at all.
For <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>  is better than a <unk> <unk> <unk> because it doesn't <unk>
<unk> wasn't <unk>
So when it becomes the <unk> <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> has a huge impact on the <unk>
<unk> <unk>  It does not only make their <unk> and say, <unk>
It's actually the one that makes decisions --  <unk> if a <unk> <unk> for example,  two <unk> with two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is less <unk>   So this is that <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  <unk> has nothing to say in this <unk>
We don't actually <unk> between the <unk>  but between the <unk> <unk>
And even when we think about the future,  <unk> we don't think about the future as a set of <unk>
We think about our future --  like <unk> <unk>
And in <unk> you can <unk> this thing,  as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> as something that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk>    <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> that  when we go to the <unk>  and this is very <unk>  So this is what happens is we go into the <unk>  In <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is pretty hard to <unk>
I mean, as we <unk> our <unk>
This is one of the things that <unk> <unk>  <unk>
And when I think about this thing, I think about a <unk>  that I <unk> in the <unk> a few years ago,  that was certainly the most beautiful <unk> that I <unk> -- and I think about it quite <unk>  how long I think about other <unk>
And I probably have been <unk>  <unk> that <unk> three weeks to <unk>  <unk> for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I was opened the <unk> <unk>  with the <unk> <unk> I would have spent another <unk>
We have <unk> on the one hand, three weeks on the other hand, at the <unk> and <unk>
There are going to be a <unk>
I could be a little <unk>  through the <unk> that I <unk> my <unk> but even though I <unk> them in a <unk> <unk>  The question <unk>
Why are we <unk> so much <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'd like to <unk> you to a <unk> <unk>
Imagine at the next <unk>  You know that at the end of the <unk>  And all the <unk> <unk> are going to be <unk>  and that will not <unk> you <unk>
<unk> the same <unk>
And if you <unk> a different <unk>  There is a <unk> between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  and you have to imagine how to <unk> this <unk> and it's not at all, because if you <unk> the time as a <unk>  you'll have a <unk>
And if you <unk> <unk> as a <unk>  You might have another <unk>
Why <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a problem that we <unk> us to a <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  I make <unk> to two different <unk> of <unk>
There are actually two <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> each other.
So you can <unk> How <unk> is <unk>
And on the other <unk> How <unk> are <unk>  of your life <unk>
And they're all <unk> <unk>
It's a pretty <unk> process.
What are the <unk> that can be <unk>
And, <unk> we are now <unk>  to make us a pretty good idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> over the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is a completely different thing.
It's not about how <unk> <unk> their life a <unk>
We talk about how <unk> <unk> is this person when you get to your life.
It's a very <unk> <unk>
Who does not <unk> between these <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I <unk> a group of <unk> <unk> <unk>  that have <unk> <unk> <unk> for a long <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> for a long <unk>  that has just <unk>
How many of you <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it was <unk> in the last few years, and they are now <unk> to <unk> them on both <unk>
<unk> <unk> does a <unk> <unk> at the level of the <unk> <unk>  that we better than half a million people have been <unk>  what I think about their life and their <unk>
And there were other <unk> <unk>
So over the last few years I've started to <unk>  some things about the two types of <unk>
And I think the <unk> of the <unk> that I <unk> is that they are different <unk>
You can <unk> how <unk> are some of them with their <unk>  and this is actually not so much about how <unk> they are in their <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Just to give you an example of a <unk>  <unk> is <unk>  This <unk> that if you <unk> someone <unk>  and <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> This is a long <unk> of <unk>
<unk> you <unk> something about his <unk>  but there is very <unk> You have <unk>  You have so <unk>
If the <unk> says that someone <unk> your life at eight to a <unk> <unk>  <unk> you have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> are the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
<unk> something about what <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that money is very <unk>  <unk> are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> with the people who are <unk> us to people who are <unk>
<unk> other <unk> these are <unk>
So if you want to <unk> the two <unk> <unk>  <unk> get to <unk> different things.
<unk> to what we said here is the <unk> that we should be talking about <unk>  like <unk> <unk>
It's a completely <unk> <unk>
Now, very <unk>  another reason why we can't <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  is that we don't think about <unk> <unk>  <unk> is that we don't think about it.
<unk> if you put a <unk> <unk> about how <unk> are the people in the <unk>  you're not going to get to the <unk> <unk>
You <unk> this <unk>  <unk> you think that people have to be more <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> you <unk>
And what happens is that when you think is that when you think about the <unk> in the <unk>  And you think about the <unk> --  -- you think about that <unk> is, for example, <unk>
It turns out that it's actually <unk>  it's not very important for <unk> <unk> and it's not very important for the <unk> <unk>  that <unk> how <unk> are <unk>
<unk> because the fact that the <unk> <unk> is at <unk>  You might -- some people might get to <unk>
And it's pretty interesting to figure out what is going to <unk>  with the people who are <unk> in the <unk> that they are going to be <unk>
So their <unk> <unk>  won't get <unk>
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen. They will think they're more <unk>
<unk> when they <unk> to this thing,  <unk> will <unk> how <unk> was at the time in the <unk>  And they will feel like the good <unk>
It's very difficult to think about <unk> and I hope I've given you a <unk> <unk>  and I hope you have a <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Chris <unk> Thank you. I have a question for <unk>
Thank you very much.
A few weeks ago, when I talked to the <unk>  <unk> you <unk> the fact that you <unk> an interesting <unk>  <unk> <unk>
You know that you can <unk> this <unk>  <unk> you have a couple of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I think the most interesting <unk> <unk> is a number of <unk> <unk>  is a number that we haven't <unk> at all.
What we found is <unk> at the <unk>  <unk> <unk>
We looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and it seems like under a <unk> <unk> <unk> dollars a year, for <unk> and this is a big number of <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is a large number of <unk> <unk> per <unk>
CA: <unk>
<unk>       <unk> dollars a year, people are <unk>  and become more <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, I have seen a <unk> <unk>
It's clear that  money doesn't get the <unk> <unk>  but their <unk> to get the <unk>  and we can <unk> this <unk>  and we can <unk> this <unk>  and we can <unk> this <unk>  and we can <unk> this <unk>
In terms of the other <unk> <unk> <unk>  we have to do with another <unk>
The more money you have to be <unk>
This is not true for <unk>
CA: But <unk> all the <unk> <unk> is about <unk> <unk> <unk>
If the world would take <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  I want to <unk> it all seems to be on the <unk>  <unk> and so on.
There are some <unk> that people <unk> as a <unk> in <unk>  to take this kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the public <unk>
<unk> <unk> I think there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> is going to be <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> but in the <unk> it <unk>  and other countries happens.
People realize that they should be <unk> to the <unk>  when they think about the <unk> <unk>
It's going to <unk> some time,  and the world is going to be <unk> <unk>  or if you want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And so we have to have this <unk> <unk>  So you have to have this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> how we <unk> and we think about <unk>  or if we think about <unk>
This is going to <unk> I think, in the <unk>
In <unk> they make <unk>  in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  This will <unk> I think, in the next two <unk>     So this is that <unk> is the <unk> or at least we should <unk>   <unk> The political <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  The political <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>    <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I <unk> I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> thank you so much because you have invented the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to talk today about energy and <unk>
And that may seem like a little bit <unk> because  My work with <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  to help the two billion <unk> <unk>
But energy and <unk> are extremely important to these people,  But even more important than anyone who are <unk> on the planet.
<unk> <unk> means that many years their <unk> will won't <unk>
It will be too much <unk> will not be <unk> <unk>
<unk> are going to change in ways --  that their <unk> just can't <unk>
And that leads to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> will be <unk> for them.
<unk> <unk> is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose one thing to do is we <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> I <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> over time.
<unk> <unk> is based on <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and even in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> known a <unk> and that's why we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and make things <unk>
And so we are in a wonderful <unk> in the <unk> world.
But once we do it more <unk> — and to try to make it times more <unk> —  We have to <unk> a new <unk> and this <unk> has to do with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is even a very <unk>
If you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>  this leads to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> and maybe more <unk> <unk> <unk>  so that the <unk> <unk> can't <unk> these <unk> <unk> and so it gets to the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> has <unk>  between growth and growth and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where there are <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> still has a <unk> <unk> but not <unk>
And there is certainly <unk> about how <unk> are going to be these <unk>  but they will be extremely <unk>
We asked scientists to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>  We really have to get about <unk>
We can't go to half or a <unk>
And the answer is, until we will get close to the <unk>  the temperature will continue to <unk>
So we have a big problem.
It's not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have to <unk> under a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> and that we somehow <unk> to <unk>
Here we have something we need to be <unk>
<unk> new <unk> a lot of carbon <unk> every year.
For every <unk> there are about 20 <unk>
For the people in <unk> countries is less than a <unk>
In <unk> to <unk> there are five <unk> for every <unk>
And <unk> we have to make changes --  that <unk> to <unk>
It grew <unk>
<unk> different <unk> <unk> have a <unk> <unk> <unk>  so we have to move from a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk>
<unk> has four <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So we have something in the <unk> <unk> that we want to get to the <unk>  And this is going to be based on the number of people, and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>
Let's look at every one of them and see how we can get to the <unk>
<unk> one of these <unk> is going to have a lot of <unk>
<unk> this is from <unk> <unk>  but let's <unk> a <unk>
First of all, we have <unk>
<unk> the world has <unk> billion people.
It's about nine <unk>
<unk> if we make a <unk> <unk> with new <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> we could <unk> that maybe 10 or 15 or 15 <unk> <unk> but we see a <unk> growth of <unk>
The second <unk> are the <unk> they <unk>
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So these are really good <unk> and <unk> <unk> means <unk> these <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet.
And it's a <unk> thing that this number to <unk>
In the world of <unk> maybe in the first <unk>  that we might be able to <unk> and use more <unk>  but every year in the <unk> is going to <unk>  So that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people will <unk> over two times.
Here we have a very <unk> <unk>
<unk> light in the house to be able to <unk> your <unk>
Well, these kids don't <unk> so they go out to the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> to the light from the <unk>
And then we <unk> the energy for every <unk>  -- here we have in <unk> something good <unk>
We have something we don't know.
<unk> different <unk> and ways of <unk> --  through different types of <unk> different ways to build <unk>  There are a lot of <unk> <unk> where you can reduce the energy to the <unk> to the <unk>
There are other <unk> such as we do <unk>  or we do <unk> <unk>  where it's much less place place for <unk>
So in <unk> if we are <unk>  might <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But for these three <unk> so <unk>  we get from <unk> billion <unk> at the <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> billion <unk> and that is not <unk>
So let's look at the <unk> <unk>  — this is going to be a key <unk> --  -- what is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the question is, you can actually <unk> it <unk>
If you <unk> not.
If you <unk> <unk> not.
<unk> every <unk> to produce <unk> today,  with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we're going to have to make a <unk> <unk>  is to create a new <unk>
So we need <unk> of <unk>
<unk> when I use <unk> I don't mean something that is <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
<unk> and his <unk> are a <unk>
The people here have the <unk> of a lot of <unk>
<unk> we don't have a <unk>  to <unk> a <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> it just <unk> and some of the <unk> some <unk>
This is a case where you really have to <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> in a pretty <unk>
So I <unk> how I could <unk> <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk>  some <unk> that might <unk> <unk> <unk>
I thought last year, I got <unk> <unk>  and it turns out that <unk> it.
It really <unk> the idea that  You know, there are people who live with <unk>
<unk> with <unk> everything I could find was this.
I thought I was going to be my <unk> <unk>  and that was my environment at this year.
So here we have some <unk> <unk>
They were told that they couldn't actually <unk> it might not <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> there are all kinds of <unk> <unk> like this,  But they don't know what they are.
We need <unk> one or more <unk>  that have a <unk> <unk> and they have a <unk> <unk>  and though people are looking for for a <unk>  and although people are looking for a big <unk>
We left the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They may be <unk> <unk>  and if they will <unk> my <unk> <unk>
But what I want to <unk> here is that you're going to have to work on each of these <unk>  and that we can't <unk> on any of them even if they seem to be <unk>  because all the <unk> <unk>
Let's take a look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>  or the <unk> <unk> or the <unk> <unk>
What we need to do here, <unk> but it is not to take <unk> after we <unk> it up and it comes to the <unk>  <unk> it comes out there.
Now we have some <unk> things that are doing it at the end of 60 to the <unk>  but the growth to the <unk> this is going to be very <unk>  and it's going to be hard to understand where we can ask these <unk>  But the most <unk> <unk> is on the <unk> <unk>
Who is going to be <unk>
Who is going to <unk> something that is <unk> billion times the kind of <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> or <unk>
It's a very big <unk>
It's a <unk> problem.
<unk> it would be <unk>
It also has three big <unk>
<unk> especially in <unk> countries are <unk>
The problem is <unk> to be <unk> that nothing can be <unk>  -- although these <unk> are not going to be used for <unk>
And then what do with <unk>
And even though they're not very <unk> they <unk> us a lot of this.
People have to be <unk> in <unk> with this.
So there are three very <unk> <unk> that may have <unk> <unk>  and so we should work on them.
And the three of the three of the three of them together.
These are the ones that the world is called <unk> <unk>
But they -- even though it's great that they don't need <unk> --  -- they have some <unk>
One is that <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk>  is much smaller than at a <unk> <unk>
These are the <unk> <unk> we talk here for a lot of <unk> <unk>  a <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> <unk>
<unk> don't <unk> all the day and not <unk> every day, but the <unk> didn't <unk> it all the time.
If you look at these <unk>  <unk> we have a way to get energy  in those <unk> when it is not <unk>
Here we have great <unk>
We have <unk> <unk>
For example, let's say that a source of energy is outside the <unk>  You don't have just <unk> <unk>  You don't just have to <unk> <unk>
And finally, there's the problem of <unk>
And to understand the <unk> I took to <unk> <unk>  all of the <unk> that are <unk>  for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> with the amount of energy that we <unk> the world and we discovered that all the <unk> that we <unk> now --  could <unk> less than 10 minutes of <unk>
So in fact, we need a <unk> <unk> here,  a hundred times better than what we have now.
It's not <unk> but it's not <unk>
This problem <unk> when we want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If we <unk> it for <unk>  We need a <unk> <unk>
<unk> how are we going to go <unk> what's the <unk>
It's a <unk> What can help us get <unk>
Well, we need a lot of <unk> to work on this, <unk>
Every one of these five <unk> we need at least 100 people.
And in many of you will be looking and say that they're <unk> That's good.
I think here in TED <unk>  We have a lot of people who are on this <unk>
Bill <unk> has some <unk> between the <unk> that one called <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> of <unk> <unk>  that make things <unk> and have <unk> <unk>  And I try to <unk> it.
<unk> <unk> and I actually <unk> a company --  that maybe <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk>
There are some <unk> in the field of <unk> <unk>
But <unk> actually has been <unk> in this <unk> a lot of <unk>  So there would be some good ideas on the <unk>
The point is, instead of <unk> a part of the <unk>  that <unk> which is <unk>  We decided to <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> idea.
It was actually talking about it for a lot of <unk>  but it has never been able to <unk> how it must <unk> or not.
Just because of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --  -- now using <unk> <unk> <unk> it seems to be <unk>
And because it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a lot of <unk>
In fact, <unk> <unk> and we can use as a <unk>  all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of making <unk> for them, <unk> it is a <unk> thing.
<unk> <unk> as it <unk> It's like a <unk>
You can see here a kind of <unk> called <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> this really <unk> <unk>
I have a picture of a place in the <unk>
These are the <unk> <unk>  <unk> after that <unk> the part of the <unk> is <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk>
<unk> the energy <unk> of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the <unk> <unk> of a big <unk> process in a <unk> process,  we would have enough to the entire life of life.
So we <unk> a lot of <unk>  but it's an example of a lot of hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk>
Let's imagine what we might <unk>
How should we look like our <unk> <unk>
Well, let's see where we have to <unk> <unk>  and then we look at the <unk> <unk>
For <unk> you've heard a lot of the world talking about this <unk> <unk>
It's very important to get there.
And the 20 percent will be <unk> by what is happening in <unk> countries and <unk>
Let's <unk> that we're going to be <unk> <unk>
To get to the 80 to <unk> countries and <unk> countries like <unk>  <unk> countries like <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is if we <unk> this technology with <unk> <unk> <unk>  if we were <unk> in all the <unk> countries, and we are in <unk> to the rest of the world.
This is important.
This is a key <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> one step of the <unk> what should look like <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, again, it should have two <unk>
We should <unk> these <unk> <unk> to begin to have <unk>
The more <unk> the more <unk> the more <unk> will be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>  and so the temperature temperature of the <unk>
But in a way, the <unk> that you <unk>  doing things that don't take us to big <unk>  -- it's just a <unk> or maybe even less important than <unk>  which is the <unk> of these <unk>
These <unk> have to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and that we can <unk> in the <unk> with the <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> that have been <unk>
<unk> wrote a lot of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk>
They take all to <unk> and they create a structure and it creates a structure of these things,  because we need a <unk> <unk> for that.
We have a lot of things to be <unk>
It's a <unk>
It's a very <unk> so that we can <unk> this <unk>
So if I could just <unk> a <unk> for the next 50 years,  I could choose who was <unk>  I could <unk> a <unk> thing that <unk> me <unk>  I could <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So this is what I <unk>
It has the <unk> <unk>
If we don't <unk> this <unk>  <unk> <unk> between the people who think about the long <unk> will be <unk> between the United States and the <unk> between the United States and the <unk> between the United States and <unk> <unk> and especially the life of the <unk>
What do you have to <unk>
What <unk> <unk> <unk> to do <unk> and <unk>
We need more <unk> <unk>
When the countries are <unk> for example of <unk>  shouldn't be talking about <unk>
We should talk about this plan <unk>
<unk> <unk> how little little <unk> are <unk>  for these <unk> <unk>
It also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that you have heard <unk> <unk>
We have to <unk> <unk>
We need this <unk> to become more <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> but that I think we can <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris <unk> Thank you.
<unk> <unk> to get better about <unk>  First of all, you can give an idea of <unk> <unk>
Bill <unk> To make the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> which I also <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even after we <unk> our <unk> in a <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> that our <unk> work <unk> how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
And after the <unk> on the <unk> if it <unk> in the <unk>  then it's clear that the light <unk> because the <unk> <unk> are very different from the <unk> <unk>
CA: So to understand how this is this <unk> to build in <unk> to <unk> <unk>  of a kind of a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And then it starts <unk> the process and it goes into the <unk>
<unk> That's what it is. It's all time you have to <unk> <unk>  that there are a lot of people and a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> objects in the <unk>
That's not good.
If you have <unk> very <unk> that you can <unk> over there 60 years —  — we can <unk> it with a <unk> --  <unk> it <unk> and you don't have the same <unk>
<unk> there and <unk> for 60 years, and then it's <unk>
CA: It's a <unk> <unk> which is also your own <unk> of <unk>
<unk> Yeah. Well, what happens to the <unk>  <unk> you can let them there — there are much more <unk> <unk> in the way that —  And then you can even take them and put it in the <unk>
And we start with the <unk> that <unk> today,  <unk> now in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
From this <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is a problem for these <unk>  is really <unk> <unk> for our <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: But in <unk> with <unk> people around the world,  where you have found the largest <unk> to do something <unk>
<unk> I don't have a <unk> place, and there are all these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk>  that people in the company went to <unk> India, <unk>
I met here with the <unk> <unk> and I talked about  the place of this ideas in <unk> <unk>
There are <unk> to know that <unk> and <unk> have been <unk>
This is a <unk> of something that has <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> but it's like a very quickly <unk> and a lot of countries have been <unk> to be the one of the countries that have built a quickly <unk> can be the first one of them.
CA: What do you <unk> when and what do you <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> For one of the great <unk> <unk>  which is very <unk>  that is very <unk>  we have been 20 years to <unk> it.
This is a little bit of the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk>  showed you that you have to <unk>
And the <unk> if things go well, what is a big <unk>  might <unk> <unk>
Now the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  We also need to be <unk> and if their <unk> <unk> <unk> if they <unk> for their <unk> <unk> <unk> go well, I can go for that.
And it's the best if you <unk> it <unk>  because then we could <unk> <unk>
We need at least one to <unk>
CA: As changes on a <unk> <unk>  This is the largest <unk> that we <unk>
<unk> A <unk> is the most important thing.
It would be even without the <unk> <unk>  but <unk> <unk> <unk> do the more <unk>
In the <unk> there are other <unk>
<unk> don't <unk> their work as well as this <unk>  but there are the people who go on the <unk> which is another <unk>
There are also a <unk> <unk> that seems a little bit <unk>  but maybe they say the same about us.
So there's a <unk>
The <unk> is that a <unk> <unk> has a million times more energy to <unk> a <unk>
So if we can solve <unk> <unk>  which is in the <unk> <unk>  And then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  like <unk> and so <unk>  <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: But if it's not going to <unk>
We're going to have to start taking <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> the temperature of the <unk>
<unk> If we get to <unk> that <unk>  is like you <unk> too much and you're going to have a <unk> <unk>
So what do you <unk> You may need <unk> <unk> or that.
There is a <unk> <unk> of what <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> different <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  20 or 30 years, we've been <unk>
But this is just a <unk> <unk>
We don't need it.
Some say that we don't even have to work on the <unk> <unk>  because the <unk> could make <unk>  because <unk> could make <unk>  that we were going to <unk> because we know that it's going to <unk> our <unk>
I don't think this is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>  but there are in this <unk>  if you shouldn't have <unk> <unk> in the case that things are <unk> or whether this <unk> is going much more <unk> than we <unk>
CA: <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> or <unk>  What does it say to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Those who have <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
<unk> there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are very, very <unk> things that they can <unk>
They have a <unk> from a million <unk>
The problem here is like <unk>
<unk> <unk> now and <unk> for it much later.
When you have all kinds of <unk> <unk>  The idea is to <unk> <unk> now to have a <unk> later, and and the <unk> is kind of <unk>
In fact, we have <unk> <unk> that don't <unk> the <unk>  and there are people in the <unk> world who look at <unk> and say, <unk> it's not that <unk>
In fact, <unk> we just have to think about that.
But my <unk> here is to <unk> a <unk> <unk>  and I was trying to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and then the <unk> will say, <unk>  <unk> I don't really care about <unk> <unk>  But I don't really care about the <unk>  But I'm not going to do it because it's more <unk> than ever before.
CA: So this would be your response to <unk> <unk> <unk>  that it says that if you get so energy to solve the problem to solve the <unk>  You don't think about <unk> the other <unk>  We're not trying to <unk> the world of <unk> <unk> and <unk>  So we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of money for that when they're better <unk>
<unk> In fact, <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>  — to say that the United States should be 10 billion a year than now --  I'm not so <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> that I <unk> <unk> and here people can not be <unk>  is when you try to <unk> something <unk>
<unk> for me, it's <unk> to me, it's a lot of the <unk> <unk> when you're almost <unk> and just <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and it's going to become very <unk>
I think we should try to get more things that have <unk> to be much more <unk>
If we go to the <unk> to make the energy <unk>  then <unk> can <unk> it.
<unk> of us here might be <unk> five times as much as energy to <unk> <unk>
<unk> is for the two <unk>
And it really <unk>
His <unk> now is why not <unk> more about <unk>
Because of the <unk> from the past is in <unk>  <unk> <unk> but it realized that it's a pretty <unk> <unk>  So it <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> is a <unk> how <unk> <unk> it is.
CA: <unk> <unk> that I talk to the name for most people here when I say you to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thank you so much.
<unk> <unk>
I want to show you a <unk> that made a couple of months ago,  while <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I always <unk> to <unk>
But I already <unk> to write <unk>  and I realized that I never <unk> the word <unk> in <unk>
Let me show you the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I read a <unk> <unk> and my <unk>
It was <unk>
And after I went to <unk> my <unk>  and I had to <unk> my <unk>  and I had to <unk> my <unk> <unk>
It was my <unk> <unk>
I thought, <unk> was <unk> <unk>
But he came out of the <unk> in the beginning of the <unk>  when he <unk> the <unk> and I understand where I <unk> outside the <unk>  and how I was thinking about <unk> and the world around me.
<unk> <unk> that on the time you don't have a <unk>
And after this <unk> it turns out that I was born in a world  that <unk> someone like me --  has no <unk> <unk>
But today, they are <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I <unk> right to <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> to find a <unk> <unk>
So here's the new <unk>
<unk> there is nothing better.
<unk> two <unk> <unk> are <unk>  <unk> and <unk>
Not just words are <unk>
We know what people think about what we call the <unk>
It's the <unk> behind the <unk> and how we <unk> them.
Our <unk> our <unk> and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and <unk> people.
In fact, a lot of <unk> <unk> including <unk> and <unk>  I think that a <unk> <unk> <unk> was very <unk> because when I was <unk> it was very <unk> because when I was <unk> to <unk> it.
So what do we want to <unk>
One person who has a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
By the way, that we actually call a <unk> a <unk> a <unk>  might <unk> the power that we <unk>
It wouldn't be better to get a <unk>
A man who opened me a <unk> was my <unk> in <unk>  from <unk> <unk> <unk>
His name is <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  It looks like it's too difficult to <unk>
So they said to their <unk>
<unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk> and had <unk> <unk> to work with <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was trying to make <unk> <unk>  with these <unk> <unk> <unk> of different <unk>  to <unk> my <unk> <unk>
<unk> percent of all the <unk>
They <unk> them.
<unk> I was five years old, I was going to <unk> <unk> to <unk> to those <unk>  <unk> of course, no <unk>
One day, he came to the <unk> <unk>
<unk> some <unk> <unk> and <unk>
and he said, <unk> you're a <unk> so <unk>  <unk> I think I'm going to <unk> one of these <unk>  <unk> I think I'm going to <unk> one of these <unk>  This was the <unk> <unk> <unk>  This was the <unk> <unk> <unk>  So I think I'm going to be the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what he did was he <unk> a <unk> <unk>  in a new <unk> and <unk>
And I <unk> and today as <unk>  the fact that he said that I'm a powerful <unk>  of the way that I see me today,  like a powerful person and <unk>
This is an example of the <unk> where the <unk> can <unk> the power of a <unk>
But through those <unk> of <unk>  our language doesn't allow us to create the reality that we all have a <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Our <unk> is not <unk> with climate change,  many of them are <unk> <unk>
<unk> that from a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk>  that allow people to take their value to their <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> of their <unk>  that allow people to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that allow people to <unk> <unk> <unk>  that allow people to <unk> their <unk>
Maybe the technology is <unk> us <unk>  what was always true.
And I think that every man has something <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and that the ability to <unk> is <unk> the largest <unk> of our <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> is a <unk> thing,  because people are always always going to talk to them about <unk> <unk>  and I'm going to give you a <unk>
I never <unk> this <unk>  and I <unk> with the <unk> of people about it.
I think I started to understand <unk>
<unk> in the problem of <unk> <unk>  is also the idea that the <unk> or the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>  without being <unk> by this <unk>  without being a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> or what I see as my <unk>
But in fact, we are <unk> We are <unk> <unk> by a <unk> <unk> or <unk>
I want to <unk> that this is a good thing.
<unk> is not a <unk> that we need to <unk>  to live our lives in <unk>
<unk> part of our life.
I think it's a kind of <unk>
I see a pretty <unk> I see <unk> <unk> <unk>  but it's always with me.
I'm not trying to <unk> the impact of a person with <unk>
In life there are <unk> and <unk>  for each of us, but the question is not if you're going to <unk> this <unk>  but the way you're going to <unk> to it.
So our <unk> is not just to <unk> the <unk> <unk> the ones that you <unk>  but also to keep them <unk>
We make them a <unk> <unk>  when we get them to <unk>
There is an important <unk> <unk> between the fact that I have <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> whether or not we have a <unk>
And in order to be <unk> the only <unk> that I <unk> to be <unk> by those <unk>
<unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> you only see what is in <unk> with you <unk>  can be much more <unk> than <unk> <unk>
Because they don't <unk> the person in the <unk> and they don't <unk> <unk>  <unk> them another <unk> <unk> on the other <unk> that I <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of that man in <unk>
So we have to see through the <unk> of the things that is capable of <unk>
And <unk> there are a <unk> <unk> in between those <unk> and the biggest <unk> <unk> of our <unk>
We don't have to <unk> or <unk> these <unk> <unk>  to <unk> them or <unk> them with <unk>  but find out the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the idea that I want to <unk> is not only to <unk> <unk> but also to think about it,  — let's just take a <unk>  to make it <unk>   So maybe I can actually <unk> with it.
And maybe we're going to see <unk> as something <unk> <unk> and <unk>  something that we don't get <unk>
In this year, the <unk> <unk> <unk> 200 years ago,      <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> about the human <unk>
In order to <unk> not the <unk> <unk> <unk> and not the <unk> but that can be <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
From the <unk> of <unk> among <unk> we can see that this is the ability to <unk> and <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk>
And maybe until we are <unk> we don't know why we're <unk>
Maybe this gives us <unk>  a <unk> of <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>
So we can make a <unk>
We can <unk> <unk> as something more than <unk> <unk>
We can see it as a <unk>
<unk> is the change that we have no <unk>
I think the biggest <unk> that I <unk>  is the idea of <unk>
Who is <unk>
There is no <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> <unk> but not <unk>
And you would really like to <unk> a <unk> <unk>
I don't know.
If we can change this <unk> from the <unk> to the <unk>  to <unk> or <unk> to tell you a little bit more than <unk>  and we can <unk> the <unk> of many children and <unk> them into the <unk>
<unk> tell us that the only thing --  that we humans asked the <unk> <unk>  was to be able to <unk>
It was discovered that the <unk> people were <unk> years ago,  <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> because their <unk> of <unk>
They don't <unk> these people as <unk> or <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and <unk>
A couple of years ago, I was in a <unk> of my <unk> <unk>  in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I <unk> at a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> I was in <unk> <unk>
I heard the <unk> of a man behind the <unk> <unk> to <unk> if it's not <unk> <unk>  And I went back and I saw a <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And I said, <unk> <unk> We <unk> our <unk> <unk>  He said, <unk> how to be <unk> <unk>
<unk> we've just <unk> your mother to <unk>
So he <unk>
And I got my <unk>
<unk> my father was <unk>  a man who I knew just from my <unk> <unk>  <unk> I came to the world with a <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> <unk> in <unk>
So the one who helped my <unk> in the world was a <unk> for <unk> <unk>
And because I was born without <unk>  and because I had the <unk> <unk> and just a few <unk> at the <unk>  he had to give them <unk>
He said, <unk> I had to say <unk> <unk>  <unk> you won't go <unk>  <unk> you will never have the <unk>  <unk> you will never have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> you <unk> that I <unk> <unk>        What is more <unk> is the fact that it has <unk>  <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk>
When I <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  when I was with the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  when I took my <unk> to the <unk> or the <unk> of my <unk> <unk>
He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And we <unk> this <unk> <unk>  <unk> human <unk>
<unk> <unk> could not stay in the <unk> <unk>  like <unk> in the quality of life.
And the <unk> said to me,  <unk> my <unk> if she didn't say <unk>  <unk> if she <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is left to do what a child is going to do <unk>
<unk> made that change in <unk>
He understood that there is a <unk> between <unk> <unk> and the way that someone <unk> to it.
And my <unk> changed over the <unk>
If you asked me about 15 years ago,  if I would give you a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> I wouldn't have any <unk>
<unk> <unk> at that kind of <unk>
If I <unk> I'm not so <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that we've had with them -- and not <unk> despite the <unk>
Maybe this change in me was <unk>  because I was <unk> to more people who opened my <unk> to <unk> than the people who opened me in the <unk>
So <unk> you don't need a <unk> <unk>  to have <unk> <unk> <unk> and you're on the right <unk>
If you can give them the <unk> of its <unk> <unk> <unk>  human <unk> is so <unk> If you can do it and make it <unk>  and you <unk> it <unk>
<unk> him to <unk> his <unk>
In fact, the word <unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk>
It means to <unk> what is in the <unk>  to <unk> <unk>
So what do we <unk> we want to <unk>
There was a study study in the <unk> in the <unk> when they went from <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had a more <unk> <unk> the best <unk> <unk>
<unk> for three months,  <unk> with <unk> <unk> have been <unk> <unk>  They were told that they were <unk>
And after this period of three months, it was <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has been told me that they were <unk> <unk>
And that happened after three <unk>
Some of them were in <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of this study is that and <unk> have been <unk>
They didn't think that they changed something.
The <unk> was said that <unk> have <unk> He also <unk>
And they <unk> their <unk>
I think the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk>  that doesn't have <unk>
You can't see the <unk>
It doesn't have the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> we can <unk> the <unk> of a man to <unk> the <unk> of a man to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> <unk>  It means that we use our power as we <unk>
When a <unk> has those <unk> we can create new <unk> and create new ways of <unk>
I want to leave you with a <unk>  <unk> by a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is called <unk> who just knows four <unk>
<unk> child met <unk>  <unk> God <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> God of <unk>  <unk> a God who just knows four words and <unk> them all <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
<unk> and <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
