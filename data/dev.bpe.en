L@@ ast y@@ ear I sho@@ w@@ ed these two s@@ li@@ de@@ s so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three mil@@ lion years has been the si@@ ze of the low@@ er 4@@ 8 st@@ at@@ es, has sh@@ r@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
But this underst@@ at@@ es the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of this partic@@ ul@@ ar prob@@ le@@ m because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ n@@ ess of the ice.
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating hear@@ t of the glob@@ al cl@@ im@@ ate system@@ .
It ex@@ pan@@ ds in w@@ in@@ ter and contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The next s@@ li@@ de I show you will be a rap@@ id f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ war@@ d of wh@@ at's happen@@ ed over the last 2@@ 5 year@@ s.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.
A@@ s you se@@ e, it ex@@ pan@@ ds to the d@@ ar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that's the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ inter@@ ,
and it contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice, fi@@ ve years old or ol@@ der@@ , you can see is al@@ most like b@@ loo@@ d, sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here@@ .
In 2@@ 5 years it's g@@ one from this, to this.
This is a prob@@ le@@ m because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the f@@ ro@@ z@@ en gro@@ und around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an,
where there is a ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve am@@ oun@@ t of f@@ ro@@ z@@ en car@@ b@@ on wh@@ ic@@ h, when it th@@ a@@ w@@ s, is tur@@ ned into me@@ th@@ ane by mic@@ ro@@ b@@ es.
C@@ om@@ p@@ are@@ d to the tot@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of glob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing pol@@ lu@@ tion in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ , that am@@ oun@@ t could dou@@ ble if we cr@@ os@@ s this tip@@ p@@ ing poin@@ t.

Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ ho@@ a@@ ! A@@ l G@@ o@@ re@@ : S@@ he@@ 's o@@ k@@ a@@ y. The quest@@ ion is wh@@ e@@ ther we will b@@ e.
And one reas@@ on is, this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and from the nor@@ th@@ .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver@@ .

This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q R@@ i@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ an@@ d.
If you want to know how s@@ ea le@@ ve@@ l ris@@ es from l@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ ase ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the sea@@ .
Th@@ ese f@@ low@@ s are incre@@ as@@ ing very rap@@ i@@ d@@ l@@ y.
A@@ t the other end of the plan@@ et, An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ g@@ est ma@@ s@@ s of ice on the plan@@ et.

That's e@@ qu@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of s@@ ea le@@ vel@@ , as is G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ an@@ d.
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as@@ , the th@@ ir@@ d lar@@ g@@ est ma@@ s@@ s of ic@@ e: at the to@@ p you see new la@@ k@@ es, which a few years ag@@ o were gl@@ ac@@ ier@@ s.
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get hal@@ f of their dr@@ in@@ king wat@@ er from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low@@ .
In the An@@ de@@ s, this gl@@ ac@@ i@@ er is the s@@ our@@ ce of dr@@ in@@ king wat@@ er for this cit@@ y.
The f@@ low@@ s have incre@@ as@@ ed.
But when they go a@@ wa@@ y, so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king wat@@ er.
In C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ pac@@ k.
This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.

F@@ our tim@@ es as many in the last 3@@ 0 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ .
This is a compl@@ et@@ ely un@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pat@@ tern@@ .
If you look at in the con@@ tex@@ t of h@@ ist@@ ory you can see what this is do@@ ing.
In the last fi@@ ve years we've ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 mil@@ lion t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s -- 2@@ 5 mil@@ lion t@@ ons every day to the o@@ ce@@ an@@ s.

L@@ ast y@@ ear at TED I ga@@ ve an intr@@ o@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
And I pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that m@@ ach@@ ine wor@@ ke@@ d.
So this is it. And for those of you that w@@ ere@@ n't the@@ re, the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ g@@ est scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c exper@@ im@@ ent ever at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers in ci@@ r@@ cum@@ feren@@ ce. It@@ s jo@@ b is to re@@ cre@@ ate the con@@ d@@ iti@@ ons that were pres@@ ent less than a bil@@ li@@ on@@ th of a sec@@ ond after the uni@@ ver@@ se be@@ gan@@ , up to 6@@ 00 mil@@ lion tim@@ es a sec@@ on@@ d.
It's no@@ thing if not am@@ b@@ iti@@ ou@@ s.
This is the m@@ ach@@ ine bel@@ o@@ w G@@ en@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pic@@ tu@@ res of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang@@ s in@@ side de@@ te@@ c@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ te@@ c@@ t@@ or -- 4@@ 4 m@@ et@@ ers w@@ ide@@ , 2@@ 2 m@@ et@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er. S@@ p@@ ect@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der constr@@ uc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale.
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last y@@ ear we tur@@ ned the m@@ ach@@ ine on for the first tim@@ e.
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ k@@ en by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S@@ .
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se cel@@ e@@ br@@ ation in the contr@@ ol ro@@ om@@ .
It's a pic@@ ture of the first b@@ eam partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , col@@ li@@ ding with a pi@@ ec@@ e of the L@@ H@@ C de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ el@@ y, and sho@@ w@@ er@@ ing partic@@ les into the de@@ te@@ c@@ t@@ or.
In other wor@@ ds, when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we k@@ new the m@@ ach@@ ine wor@@ ke@@ d, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know wh@@ e@@ ther this got the bi@@ gg@@ est ch@@ e@@ er, or this, when some@@ one went on@@ to G@@ oo@@ g@@ le and sa@@ w the fr@@ on@@ t p@@ age was like that.
It me@@ ans we made cul@@ tur@@ al im@@ p@@ act as w@@ ell as scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c im@@ pac@@ t.
A@@ b@@ out a we@@ e@@ k lat@@ er we had a prob@@ le@@ m with the m@@ ach@@ in@@ e, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wi@@ re@@ s.
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ r@@ y 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and am@@ p@@ s when the m@@ ach@@ ine is wor@@ king in ful@@ l pow@@ er.
Now the en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ N@@ o they don@@ '@@ t. Th@@ ey@@ 're sm@@ all wi@@ res@@ ."
They can do that because when they are very col@@ d they are wh@@ at's called su@@ per@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es, col@@ der than the sp@@ ace between the star@@ s, those wi@@ res can take that cur@@ ren@@ t.
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ n@@ et@@ s in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up s@@ li@@ ght@@ ly, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ p@@ s su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ te@@ red electr@@ ical re@@ sist@@ an@@ ce.
This was the res@@ ul@@ t.
Now that's more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve when you consi@@ der those mag@@ n@@ et@@ s we@@ i@@ gh over 20 t@@ on@@ s, and they mo@@ ved about a fo@@ o@@ t.
So we da@@ mag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ n@@ et@@ s.
We had to take them ou@@ t, which we di@@ d.
We re@@ con@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ ed them all@@ , fi@@ x@@ ed them.
Th@@ ey@@ 're all on their way back under@@ gro@@ und no@@ w.
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again@@ .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we ex@@ p@@ ect to take data in J@@ une or J@@ ul@@ y, and continu@@ e with our qu@@ est to find out what the buil@@ ding b@@ loc@@ ks of the uni@@ ver@@ se are.
Now of cour@@ se, in a way those ac@@ ci@@ dent@@ s re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of scien@@ ce and en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing at the ed@@ g@@ e. It's eas@@ y to re@@ f@@ u@@ te.
I think that the fac@@ t that it's so diff@@ icul@@ t, the fac@@ t that we're o@@ ver@@ re@@ ach@@ ing, is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I will lea@@ ve the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an E@@ n@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h scien@@ ti@@ st@@ , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, when de@@ f@@ en@@ ding his prote@@ ge@@ 's us@@ el@@ ess exper@@ iment@@ s -- his prote@@ ge was M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ a@@ y -- sai@@ d this, "@@ No@@ thing is so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to the pro@@ g@@ res@@ s of the human min@@ d than to as@@ sum@@ e that our vie@@ ws of scien@@ ce are ultim@@ ate, that there are no m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es in n@@ at@@ u@@ re, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are compl@@ e@@ te, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, pla@@ ying with b@@ loc@@ k@@ s.
A@@ s you fi@@ gu@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ , pic@@ k them up and mo@@ ve them aro@@ un@@ d, you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve problem@@ s by underst@@ and@@ ing and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
S@@ p@@ ati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ e@@ pl@@ y con@@ nec@@ ted to how we underst@@ and a lot of the world around us.
So, as a com@@ pute@@ r scien@@ ti@@ st in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by this ut@@ il@@ ity of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with ph@@ ys@@ ical ob@@ j@@ ect@@ s -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ at@@ ti@@ e, and my col@@ l@@ abor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to won@@ der -- what if when we used a com@@ puter@@ , inst@@ ea@@ d of ha@@ ving this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a di@@ g@@ it@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mo@@ ving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ to@@ p@@ , what if we could re@@ ach in with bo@@ th han@@ ds and gr@@ as@@ p inform@@ ation ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ally,
ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it the way we wan@@ te@@ d@@ ?
This quest@@ ion was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we deci@@ ded to expl@@ ore the ans@@ w@@ er, by buil@@ ding S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ abl@@ es.
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell, a S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ tive com@@ pute@@ r the si@@ ze of a co@@ o@@ ki@@ e.
Th@@ ey@@ 're able to be mo@@ ved around by han@@ d, they can sen@@ se each oth@@ er, they can sen@@ se their mo@@ tion@@ , and they have a sc@@ re@@ en and a wi@@ rel@@ ess ra@@ di@@ o.
M@@ ost import@@ ant@@ ly, they're ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ al, so like the b@@ loc@@ k@@ s, you can mo@@ ve them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing.
And S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an exam@@ ple of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em of to@@ ol@@ s for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating di@@ g@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation.
And as these to@@ ol@@ s bec@@ ome more ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ al, more a@@ w@@ are of their mo@@ tion@@ , a@@ w@@ are of each oth@@ er, and a@@ w@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we mo@@ ve the@@ m, we can start to expl@@ ore some new and f@@ un inter@@ ac@@ tion st@@ y@@ l@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some sim@@ ple exam@@ pl@@ es.
This S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able is con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to show vide@@ o, and if I t@@ il@@ t it in one direc@@ tion@@ , it@@ 'll r@@ ol@@ l the vide@@ o this wa@@ y@@ ; if I t@@ il@@ t it the other way it r@@ ol@@ l@@ s it bac@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ s.
And these inter@@ ac@@ tive por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ w@@ are of each oth@@ er.
So if I put them next to each oth@@ er, they get interest@@ ed.
If they get sur@@ ro@@ un@@ de@@ d, they no@@ t@@ ice that to@@ o, they might get a little f@@ lu@@ st@@ ere@@ d.
And they can also sen@@ se their mo@@ tion and t@@ il@@ t.
O@@ ne of the interest@@ ing im@@ plic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ , we started to realiz@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day g@@ est@@ u@@ res on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
So in this cas@@ e, we've got three S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les con@@ fi@@ gu@@ red to be p@@ ain@@ t buc@@ k@@ et@@ s and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that centr@@ al on@@ e, where they get mi@@ x@@ ed.
If we o@@ vers@@ ho@@ o@@ t, we can p@@ our a little bit bac@@ k.
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es for educ@@ ation, like l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the abil@@ ity to try things qu@@ ick@@ ly, and vie@@ w the res@@ ul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
So here I'm -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ ci se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce that I'm ma@@ king with a sim@@ ple e@@ qu@@ ation progr@@ am@@ .
H@@ ere we have a wor@@ d g@@ ame that's kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ o@@ gg@@ l@@ e.
B@@ as@@ ic@@ ally, in every ro@@ und you get a ran@@ dom@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned let@@ ter on each S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ abl@@ e, and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks again@@ st a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y.
Th@@ en, after about 3@@ 0 sec@@ on@@ ds, it re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new se@@ t of let@@ ter@@ s and new possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some ki@@ ds that came on a fi@@ el@@ d tri@@ p to the M@@ e@@ di@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it ou@@ t, and sho@@ o@@ t a vide@@ o.
They really lo@@ ved it.
An@@ d, one of the interest@@ ing things about this kind of ap@@ plic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tion@@ s.
A@@ ll you have to say is, "@@ M@@ a@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know ex@@ act@@ ly what to do@@ .
So here@@ 's another few people trying it ou@@ t.
That's our y@@ oun@@ g@@ est bet@@ a te@@ st@@ er, down there on the ri@@ gh@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, all he wan@@ ted to do was to st@@ ac@@ k the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les up@@ .
So to h@@ im@@ , they were just b@@ loc@@ k@@ s.
Now, this is an inter@@ ac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on ap@@ plic@@ ation.
And we wan@@ ted to buil@@ d a lear@@ ning to@@ ol for l@@ ang@@ u@@ age lear@@ ner@@ s.
And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x@@ , actu@@ all@@ y.
And he can br@@ ing new ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s into the sc@@ en@@ e, just by lif@@ ting the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them.
H@@ ere@@ , he@@ 's br@@ ing@@ ing the s@@ un ou@@ t.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : The s@@ un is ris@@ ing.
D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ er@@ r@@ ill@@ : Now he@@ 's br@@ ou@@ ght a tr@@ act@@ or into the sc@@ en@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : The or@@ ang@@ e tr@@ act@@ or.
G@@ o@@ od j@@ ob@@ ! Y@@ ea@@ h@@ !
D@@ M@@ : So by s@@ ha@@ king the S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les and put@@ ting them next to each other he can make the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s inter@@ act -- V@@ ide@@ o@@ : W@@ o@@ of@@ !
D@@ M@@ : inv@@ ent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ r@@ ati@@ ve.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : H@@ el@@ lo@@ !
D@@ M@@ : It's an o@@ pen@@ -@@ en@@ ded st@@ or@@ y, and he get@@ s to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ d@@ s.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : F@@ ly a@@ wa@@ y, c@@ at.
D@@ M@@ : So, the last exam@@ ple I have time to show you to@@ day is a mus@@ ic se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing and li@@ ve per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ ol that we've buil@@ t rec@@ ent@@ ly, in which S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ un@@ ds like lea@@ d, bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s.
E@@ ach of these has f@@ our different v@@ ari@@ ation@@ s, you get to ch@@ o@@ ose which one you want to us@@ e.
And you can in@@ j@@ ect these so@@ un@@ ds into a se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce that you can as@@ sem@@ ble into the pat@@ ter@@ n that you wan@@ t.
And you in@@ j@@ ect it by just b@@ um@@ p@@ ing up the so@@ und S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ able again@@ st a se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ abl@@ e.
There are eff@@ ect@@ s that you can contr@@ ol li@@ ve, like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter@@ .
You at@@ t@@ ach it to a partic@@ ul@@ ar so@@ und and then t@@ il@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And th@@ en, o@@ ver@@ all eff@@ ect@@ s like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ um@@ e that ap@@ pl@@ y to the enti@@ re se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce. So let@@ 's have a loo@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : We@@ 'll start by put@@ ting a lea@@ d into two se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ abl@@ es, ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e them into a ser@@ i@@ es, ex@@ ten@@ d it, ad@@ d a little more lea@@ d.
Now I put a bas@@ s l@@ ine in.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : Now I'@@ ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : And now I'@@ ll at@@ t@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s, so I can contr@@ ol the eff@@ ect li@@ ve.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : I can sp@@ e@@ ed up the wh@@ ole se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce by t@@ il@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the oth@@ er.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : And now I'@@ ll at@@ t@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ si@@ on.
V@@ ide@@ o@@ : D@@ M@@ : I can re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ e the se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce wh@@ ile it pla@@ y@@ s.
So I don't have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ an@@ ce, but I can im@@ pro@@ vis@@ e, ma@@ king it l@@ ong@@ er or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go@@ .
And no@@ w, fin@@ ally, I can fa@@ de the wh@@ ole se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce out using the vol@@ um@@ e S@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ abl@@ e, t@@ il@@ ted to the le@@ f@@ t.
Thank you.
So, as you can se@@ e, my pas@@ sion is for ma@@ king new h@@ uman@@ -@@ com@@ pute@@ r inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ in@@ s and bo@@ di@@ es wor@@ k.
And to@@ day, I had time to show you one poin@@ t in this new desig@@ n sp@@ ac@@ e, and a few of the possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es that we're wor@@ king to br@@ ing out of the l@@ abor@@ at@@ or@@ y.
So the thought I want to lea@@ ve you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ ac@@ ting with di@@ g@@ it@@ al medi@@ a that are going to br@@ ing inform@@ ation into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I look for@@ war@@ d to tal@@ king with all of you.
I am a wr@@ it@@ er.
W@@ r@@ it@@ ing bo@@ o@@ ks is my profes@@ sion but it's more than that, of cour@@ s@@ e.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong lo@@ ve and f@@ as@@ cin@@ ation.
And I don't ex@@ p@@ ect that that's ever going to chang@@ e.
B@@ ut@@ , that said, something kind of p@@ ec@@ ul@@ iar has happen@@ ed rec@@ ent@@ ly in my life and in my care@@ er, which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my wh@@ ole rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this wor@@ k.
And the p@@ ec@@ ul@@ iar thing is that I rec@@ ent@@ ly w@@ ro@@ te this bo@@ o@@ k, this mem@@ o@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ ve@@ " wh@@ ic@@ h, deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ o@@ k@@ s, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and bec@@ ame this bi@@ g@@ , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation, inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al b@@ est@@ s@@ ell@@ er thing@@ .
The res@@ ul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go no@@ w, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
L@@ i@@ k@@ e, they come up to me no@@ w, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ A@@ re@@ n't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to be able to to@@ p that@@ ?
A@@ re@@ n't you af@@ ra@@ id you're going to ke@@ ep wr@@ it@@ ing for your wh@@ ole life and you're never ag@@ a@@ in going to cre@@ ate a bo@@ ok that any@@ body in the world care@@ s about at all@@ , ever again@@ ?"
So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you kno@@ w.
But it would be wor@@ se, ex@@ cep@@ t for that I happ@@ en to re@@ mem@@ ber that over 20 years ag@@ o, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started tel@@ l@@ ing people that I wan@@ ted to be a wr@@ it@@ er, I was me@@ t with this same sort of fe@@ ar@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ ac@@ tion.
And people would say, "@@ A@@ re@@ n't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to have any suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ?
A@@ re@@ n't you af@@ ra@@ id the h@@ um@@ il@@ i@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion will k@@ ill you@@ ?
A@@ re@@ n't you af@@ ra@@ id that you're going to work your wh@@ ole life at this c@@ ra@@ f@@ t and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to di@@ e on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of b@@ ro@@ k@@ en dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th f@@ ill@@ ed with b@@ it@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ u@@ re@@ ?"
L@@ i@@ ke that, you kno@@ w.
The ans@@ w@@ er -- the sh@@ or@@ t ans@@ w@@ er to all those quest@@ ion@@ s is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm af@@ ra@@ id of all those thing@@ s.
And I al@@ ways have be@@ en@@ .
And I'm af@@ ra@@ id of man@@ y, many more things b@@ es@@ ide@@ s that people can't even gu@@ ess at,
like sea@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ar@@ y.
B@@ ut@@ , when it com@@ es to wr@@ it@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thin@@ king about lat@@ el@@ y, and won@@ der@@ ing about lat@@ el@@ y, is wh@@ y@@ ?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
I@@ s it lo@@ g@@ ical that any@@ body should be ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they fe@@ el they were put on this E@@ ar@@ th to do@@ .
And what is it speci@@ fic@@ ally about cre@@ ative v@@ ent@@ u@@ res that se@@ em@@ s to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each oth@@ er@@ 's ment@@ al heal@@ th in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do@@ , you kno@@ w@@ ?
L@@ i@@ ke my d@@ ad@@ , for exam@@ pl@@ e, was a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er and I don't rec@@ all on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king hi@@ m if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ er, you kno@@ w@@ ?
"@@ That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing b@@ loc@@ k, J@@ o@@ hn@@ , ho@@ w@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you kno@@ w@@ ?
But to be fa@@ ir@@ , ch@@ em@@ ical en@@ gin@@ e@@ ers as a gr@@ ou@@ p ha@@ ven@@ 't really ear@@ ned a re@@ put@@ ation over the cent@@ ur@@ i@@ es for being al@@ co@@ h@@ ol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ v@@ es.
We wr@@ it@@ er@@ s, we kind of do have that re@@ put@@ ation, and not just wr@@ it@@ er@@ s, but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ros@@ s all gen@@ re@@ s, it se@@ em@@ s, have this re@@ put@@ ation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ous@@ ly ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ abl@@ e.
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y al@@ on@@ e, of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed y@@ oun@@ g and of@@ ten at their own h@@ and@@ s, you kno@@ w@@ ?
And even the on@@ es who didn't lit@@ er@@ ally com@@ m@@ it su@@ ici@@ de se@@ em to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ t@@ s, you kno@@ w.
N@@ or@@ man M@@ a@@ il@@ er, just be@@ fore he di@@ ed, last inter@@ vie@@ w, he said, "@@ E@@ very one of my bo@@ o@@ ks has k@@ ill@@ ed me a little mo@@ re@@ ."
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary st@@ at@@ em@@ ent to make about your li@@ fe@@ 's wor@@ k.
But we don't even bl@@ in@@ k when we h@@ ear some@@ body say this, because we've hear@@ d that kind of stu@@ f@@ f for so l@@ ong and some@@ how we've compl@@ et@@ ely inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed and ac@@ cep@@ ted col@@ l@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing are some@@ how in@@ h@@ eren@@ t@@ ly lin@@ ked and that ar@@ ti@@ str@@ y, in the en@@ d, will al@@ ways ultim@@ at@@ ely lea@@ d to ang@@ u@@ is@@ h@@ .
And the quest@@ ion that I want to as@@ k every@@ body here to@@ day is are you gu@@ ys all co@@ ol with that ide@@ a?
A@@ re you com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that@@ ? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch a@@ way an@@ d, you know -- I'm not at all com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion.
I think it's o@@ di@@ ou@@ s.
And I also think it's d@@ ang@@ er@@ ou@@ s, and I don't want to see it per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated into the next cent@@ ur@@ y.
I think it's better if we en@@ cour@@ age our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to li@@ ve.
And I de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my c@@ ase -- in my s@@ itu@@ ation -- it would be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that d@@ ar@@ k pat@@ h of as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion@@ , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly gi@@ ven the ci@@ r@@ cum@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my care@@ er.
Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t, I'm pret@@ ty y@@ oun@@ g@@ , I'm only about 4@@ 0 years ol@@ d.
I still have ma@@ ybe another f@@ our dec@@ a@@ de@@ s of work le@@ f@@ t in m@@ e.
And it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that any@@ thing I wr@@ ite from this poin@@ t for@@ war@@ d is going to be j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ a@@ k@@ is@@ h suc@@ c@@ ess of my last bo@@ o@@ k, ri@@ ght@@ ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, because we're all sort of fri@@ en@@ ds here now -- it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly lik@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est suc@@ c@@ ess is be@@ h@@ ind m@@ e.
So J@@ es@@ us, what a thou@@ ght@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could lea@@ d a per@@ son to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o@@ '@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the mor@@ n@@ ing, and I don't want to go the@@ re.
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I lo@@ ve.
And so@@ , the quest@@ ion bec@@ om@@ es, ho@@ w@@ ?
And so@@ , it se@@ em@@ s to me, up@@ on a lot of re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion@@ , that the way that I have to work no@@ w, in or@@ der to continu@@ e wr@@ it@@ ing, is that I have to cre@@ ate some sort of prote@@ c@@ tive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical constr@@ uc@@ t, ri@@ ght@@ ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ f@@ e dist@@ ance between me, as I am wr@@ it@@ ing, and my very natur@@ al an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that wr@@ it@@ ing is going to b@@ e, from now on.
An@@ d, as I've been loo@@ k@@ ing, over the last year@@ , for mode@@ l@@ s for how to do that, I've been sort of looking ac@@ ros@@ s tim@@ e, and I've been trying to find other soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ide@@ as than we have about how to hel@@ p cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ h@@ eren@@ t emo@@ tion@@ al ris@@ ks of cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y.
And that sear@@ ch has l@@ ed me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e.
So sta@@ y with me, because it does ci@@ r@@ c@@ le around and bac@@ k.
B@@ ut@@ , an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happ@@ en to belie@@ ve that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came from human be@@ ing@@ s back th@@ en, O@@ K@@ ?
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple belie@@ ved that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ it that came to human be@@ ing@@ s from some dist@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ ce, for dist@@ ant and un@@ kno@@ w@@ able reas@@ on@@ s.
The G@@ re@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ its of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s@@ ."
S@@ o@@ cr@@ at@@ es, fam@@ ous@@ ly, belie@@ ved that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke w@@ is@@ do@@ m to hi@@ m from af@@ ar@@ .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same ide@@ a, but they called that sort of di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at, because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly c@@ le@@ ver indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al. They belie@@ ved that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity,
who was belie@@ ved to lit@@ er@@ ally li@@ ve in the w@@ all@@ s of an ar@@ ti@@ st@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ou@@ se el@@ f@@ , and who would come out and sort of in@@ vis@@ i@@ b@@ ly as@@ s@@ ist the ar@@ ti@@ st with their work and would s@@ ha@@ pe the out@@ come of that wor@@ k.
So br@@ il@@ li@@ ant -- there it is, right the@@ re, that dist@@ ance that I'm tal@@ king about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical constr@@ uc@@ t to prote@@ c@@ t you from the res@@ ul@@ ts of your wor@@ k.
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed, ri@@ ght@@ ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent ar@@ ti@@ st was prote@@ c@@ ted from cer@@ ta@@ in thing@@ s, lik@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, to@@ o much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ is@@ m, ri@@ ght@@ ?
If your work was br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ t, you c@@ oul@@ dn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, every@@ body k@@ new that you had this di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you.
If your work b@@ om@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ re@@ ly your fa@@ ul@@ t, you kno@@ w@@ ?
E@@ very@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ am@@ e.
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really l@@ ong tim@@ e.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and every@@ thing ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d, and we had this big ide@@ a, and the big idea was@@ , let@@ 's put the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al human being at the cen@@ ter of the uni@@ ver@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and m@@ y@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more ro@@ om for m@@ y@@ st@@ ical cre@@ at@@ u@@ res who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ vin@@ e.
And it's the be@@ gin@@ ning of r@@ ation@@ al h@@ uman@@ is@@ m, and people started to belie@@ ve that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came compl@@ et@@ ely from the sel@@ f of the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al.
And for the first time in h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, you start to h@@ ear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that ar@@ ti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us, ra@@ ther than ha@@ ving a gen@@ i@@ us.
And I got to tell you@@ , I think that was a hu@@ ge er@@ r@@ or.
You know, I think that al@@ low@@ ing some@@ bo@@ d@@ y, one m@@ ere per@@ son to belie@@ ve that he or she is lik@@ e, the v@@ es@@ sel@@ , you know, like the f@@ on@@ t and the es@@ sen@@ ce and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ vin@@ e, cre@@ ati@@ ve, un@@ kno@@ w@@ abl@@ e, et@@ er@@ n@@ al m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ d@@ ge to@@ o much respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity to put on one fr@@ ag@@ ile, human p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e.
It's like as@@ king some@@ body to s@@ w@@ al@@ low the sun@@ .
It just compl@@ et@@ ely war@@ p@@ s and dist@@ or@@ ts eg@@ os@@ , and it cre@@ at@@ es all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ ea@@ ble ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce.
And I think the pres@@ sur@@ e of that has been k@@ ill@@ ing off our ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s for the last 5@@ 00 year@@ s.
An@@ d, if this is tr@@ u@@ e, and I think it is tr@@ u@@ e, the quest@@ ion bec@@ om@@ es, what no@@ w@@ ?
C@@ an we do this differen@@ t@@ l@@ y@@ ?
M@@ a@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent underst@@ and@@ ing about the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between h@@ um@@ ans and the cre@@ ative m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ y.
M@@ a@@ ybe no@@ t.
M@@ a@@ ybe we can't just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of r@@ ation@@ al h@@ uman@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 1@@ 8 minu@@ te sp@@ e@@ ec@@ h@@ .
And there's probab@@ ly people in this au@@ di@@ en@@ ce who would ra@@ ise really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c s@@ us@@ p@@ ici@@ ons about the no@@ tion of@@ , bas@@ ic@@ ally, fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ low people around r@@ ub@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y j@@ u@@ ice on their pro@@ j@@ ect@@ s and stu@@ ff@@ .
I'm no@@ t, probab@@ ly, going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this.
But the quest@@ ion that I kind of want to p@@ ose is -- you know, why no@@ t@@ ?
Wh@@ y not think about it this wa@@ y@@ ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sen@@ se as any@@ thing el@@ se I have ever hear@@ d in ter@@ m@@ s of expl@@ ain@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ous@@ n@@ ess of the cre@@ ative proces@@ s.
A pro@@ c@@ ess wh@@ ic@@ h, as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ically every@@ one here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not al@@ ways be@@ have r@@ ation@@ all@@ y.
An@@ d, in fac@@ t, can som@@ et@@ im@@ es fe@@ el do@@ wn@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al.
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ent@@ ly where I me@@ t the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary Americ@@ an po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h S@@ t@@ on@@ e, wh@@ o@@ 's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but sh@@ e's been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life and she t@@ old me that when she was gro@@ w@@ ing up in r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ gin@@ i@@ a, she would be out wor@@ king in the fi@@ el@@ ds, and she sai@@ d she would fe@@ el and h@@ ear a po@@ em com@@ ing at her from over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she sai@@ d it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of a@@ ir@@ .
And it would come b@@ ar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she fel@@ t it com@@ ing, because it would s@@ ha@@ ke the ear@@ th un@@ der her fe@@ et.
S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that poin@@ t, and that was to@@ , in her wor@@ ds, "@@ r@@ un like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would r@@ un like hel@@ l to the h@@ ou@@ se and she would be get@@ ting c@@ ha@@ s@@ ed by this po@@ em@@ , and the wh@@ ole de@@ al was that she had to get to a pi@@ ec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er and a pen@@ ci@@ l f@@ ast en@@ ough so that when it th@@ un@@ de@@ red through h@@ er, she could col@@ l@@ ect it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ ag@@ e.
And other tim@@ es she w@@ oul@@ dn't be f@@ ast en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , so sh@@ e@@ '@@ d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ n@@ ing, and she w@@ oul@@ dn't get to the h@@ ou@@ se and the po@@ em would b@@ ar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she sai@@ d it would continu@@ e on ac@@ ros@@ s the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, loo@@ k@@ ing, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these tim@@ es -- this is the pi@@ ec@@ e I never for@@ got -- she sai@@ d that there were mom@@ ents where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it, ri@@ ght@@ ?
So, sh@@ e's r@@ un@@ ning to the h@@ ou@@ se and sh@@ e's looking for the p@@ ap@@ er and the po@@ em pas@@ s@@ es through h@@ er, and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through h@@ er, and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other h@@ and and she would cat@@ ch it.
S@@ he would cat@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il@@ , and she would pul@@ l it bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the p@@ ag@@ e.
And in these inst@@ an@@ c@@ es, the po@@ em would come up on the p@@ age per@@ f@@ ect and in@@ t@@ act but bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds, from the last wor@@ d to the fir@@ st@@ .
So when I hear@@ d that I was like -- that's unc@@ an@@ n@@ y, that's ex@@ act@@ ly what my cre@@ ative pro@@ c@@ ess is lik@@ e.
That's not at all what my cre@@ ative pro@@ c@@ ess is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ in@@ e@@ !
I'm a mul@@ e, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ ab@@ or and b@@ ar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ l@@ y.
But even I@@ , in my mul@@ is@@ hn@@ es@@ s, even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up again@@ st that thing@@ , at tim@@ es.
And I would imag@@ ine that a lot of you have to@@ o.
You know, even I have had work or ide@@ as come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly can@@ not i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us l@@ ose our min@@ ds, b@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ an@@ e?
And for me, the b@@ est con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary exam@@ ple that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an To@@ m W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ vie@@ w se@@ ver@@ al years ag@@ o on a mag@@ az@@ ine as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment@@ .
And we were tal@@ king about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his lif@@ e, he was pret@@ ty much the em@@ bo@@ d@@ im@@ ent of the tor@@ men@@ ted con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary mo@@ der@@ n ar@@ ti@@ st@@ , trying to contr@@ ol and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ control@@ l@@ able cre@@ ative im@@ pul@@ s@@ es that were tot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der@@ , he got cal@@ mer@@ , and one day he was d@@ ri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es, and this is when it all chang@@ ed for h@@ im@@ .
And he@@ 's sp@@ e@@ e@@ ding al@@ ong@@ , and all of a su@@ d@@ de@@ n he hear@@ s this little fr@@ ag@@ ment of m@@ el@@ od@@ y, that com@@ es into his hea@@ d as in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation of@@ ten com@@ es, el@@ us@@ i@@ ve and t@@ ant@@ aliz@@ ing, and he w@@ ant@@ s it, it's g@@ or@@ ge@@ ou@@ s, and he l@@ ong@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a pi@@ ec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er, or a pen@@ c@@ il@@ , or a ta@@ pe rec@@ or@@ der@@ .
So he star@@ ts to fe@@ el all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ris@@ e in hi@@ m lik@@ e, "@@ I'm going to l@@ ose this thing@@ , and I'@@ ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g fo@@ re@@ ver@@ .
I'm not good en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , and I can't do it@@ ."
And inst@@ ea@@ d of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just st@@ op@@ pe@@ d.
He just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed that wh@@ ole ment@@ al pro@@ c@@ ess and he did something compl@@ et@@ ely no@@ vel@@ .
He just loo@@ ked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ Ex@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm d@@ ri@@ v@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ D@@ o I look like I can wr@@ ite down a son@@ g right no@@ w@@ ?
If you really want to exist@@ , come back at a more op@@ port@@ une mom@@ ent when I can take care of you.
O@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ is@@ e, go bo@@ ther some@@ body el@@ se to@@ da@@ y.
G@@ o bo@@ ther L@@ e@@ on@@ ar@@ d C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ ."
And his wh@@ ole work pro@@ c@@ ess chang@@ ed after that.
No@@ t the wor@@ k, the work was still of@@ t@@ ent@@ im@@ es as d@@ ar@@ k as e@@ ver@@ .
But the proces@@ s, and the hea@@ v@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was re@@ lea@@ s@@ ed when he to@@ ok the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of hi@@ m where it was ca@@ using no@@ thing but tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ e, and re@@ lea@@ s@@ ed it back where it came fr@@ om@@ , and realiz@@ ed that this didn't have to be this inter@@ n@@ aliz@@ ed, tor@@ men@@ ted thing@@ .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar, won@@ dr@@ ou@@ s, b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re col@@ l@@ abor@@ ation, kind of con@@ vers@@ ation between To@@ m and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not qu@@ ite T@@ om@@ .
When I hear@@ d that st@@ or@@ y, it started to shi@@ f@@ t a little bit the way that I wor@@ ked to@@ o, and this idea al@@ read@@ y sa@@ ved me on@@ ce.
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of wr@@ it@@ ing "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ ve@@ ," and I fel@@ l into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ sp@@ a@@ ir that we all f@@ all into when we're wor@@ king on something and it's not com@@ ing and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ ast@@ er, the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever wr@@ it@@ ten@@ .
No@@ t just b@@ ad@@ , but the wor@@ st bo@@ ok ever wr@@ it@@ ten@@ .
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t.
But then I re@@ mem@@ b@@ ere@@ d To@@ m tal@@ king to the op@@ en a@@ ir and I tri@@ ed it.
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ t and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ment@@ s to an em@@ pt@@ y cor@@ ne@@ r of the ro@@ om@@ .
And I sai@@ d al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you@@ , thing@@ , you and I bo@@ th know that if this bo@@ ok is@@ n't br@@ il@@ li@@ ant that is not enti@@ re@@ ly my fa@@ ul@@ t, ri@@ ght@@ ?
Because you can see that I am put@@ ting every@@ thing I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be bet@@ ter@@ , you@@ 've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know wh@@ at, the hel@@ l with it.
I'm going to ke@@ ep wr@@ it@@ ing any@@ way because that's my j@@ ob@@ .
And I would pl@@ ea@@ se like the rec@@ or@@ d to re@@ fl@@ ect to@@ day that I sho@@ w@@ ed up for my part of the j@@ ob@@ ."
Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ ur@@ i@@ es ag@@ o in the des@@ er@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Afr@@ ic@@ a, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ li@@ ght d@@ an@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and mus@@ ic that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l da@@ wn@@ .
They were al@@ ways mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent, because the d@@ an@@ cer@@ s were profes@@ sion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ fic@@ , ri@@ ght@@ ?
But every on@@ ce in a wh@@ ile, very r@@ are@@ ly, something would happen@@ , and one of these per@@ for@@ mer@@ s would actually bec@@ ome tran@@ sc@@ en@@ dent@@ .
And I know you know what I'm tal@@ king ab@@ ou@@ t, because I know you@@ 've all se@@ en, at some poin@@ t in your lif@@ e, a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this.
It was like time would st@@ op@@ , and the d@@ an@@ ce@@ r would sort of st@@ ep through some kind of port@@ al and he was@@ n't doing any@@ thing different than he had ever don@@ e, 1@@ ,000 ni@@ gh@@ ts be@@ fo@@ re, but every@@ thing would al@@ ig@@ n@@ .
And all of a su@@ d@@ den@@ , he would no l@@ ong@@ er ap@@ p@@ ear to be m@@ ere@@ ly h@@ uman@@ .
He would be l@@ it from wi@@ thin@@ , and l@@ it from bel@@ o@@ w and all l@@ it up on fi@@ re with di@@ vin@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back th@@ en, people k@@ new it for what it was@@ , you know, they called it by its n@@ am@@ e.
They would put their han@@ ds toge@@ ther and they would start to ch@@ an@@ t, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ o@@ d, G@@ od@@ ."
That's G@@ o@@ d, you kno@@ w.
C@@ ur@@ i@@ ous h@@ ist@@ or@@ ical fo@@ o@@ t@@ no@@ te@@ : when the M@@ o@@ or@@ s inv@@ a@@ ded s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n S@@ p@@ ain@@ , they to@@ ok this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chang@@ ed over the cent@@ ur@@ i@@ es from "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h@@ ," to "@@ O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ,"
which you still h@@ ear in b@@ ul@@ l@@ fi@@ gh@@ ts and in fl@@ amen@@ c@@ o d@@ an@@ c@@ es.
In S@@ p@@ ain@@ , when a per@@ form@@ er has d@@ one something im@@ possi@@ ble and mag@@ ic, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , Al@@ la@@ h, mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent, bra@@ vo@@ ,"
in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ bl@@ e, there it is -- a gl@@ im@@ p@@ se of G@@ o@@ d.
Wh@@ ich is gre@@ at, because we need that.
B@@ ut@@ , the tr@@ ick@@ y bit com@@ es the next mor@@ n@@ ing, for the d@@ an@@ ce@@ r h@@ im@@ self@@ , when he wa@@ kes up and di@@ sco@@ ver@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and he@@ 's no l@@ ong@@ er a gl@@ im@@ p@@ se of G@@ o@@ d.
H@@ e's just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es, and ma@@ ybe he@@ 's never going to as@@ cen@@ d to that he@@ i@@ ght again@@ .
And ma@@ ybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant G@@ od@@ 's n@@ ame ag@@ a@@ in as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the res@@ t of his li@@ fe@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most p@@ ain@@ ful re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ i@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative lif@@ e.
But ma@@ ybe it doesn't have to be qu@@ ite so ful@@ l of ang@@ u@@ is@@ h if you never happen@@ ed to bel@@ i@@ ev@@ e, in the first plac@@ e, that the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary as@@ p@@ ect@@ s of your being came from you.
But ma@@ ybe if you just belie@@ ved that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pas@@ s@@ ed al@@ ong when you're fin@@ is@@ he@@ d, with some@@ body el@@ s@@ e.
An@@ d, you know, if we think about it this wa@@ y, it star@@ ts to change every@@ thing@@ .
This is how I've started to thin@@ k, and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I've been thin@@ king in the last few mon@@ th@@ s as I've been wor@@ king on the bo@@ ok that will so@@ on be publi@@ sh@@ ed, as the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly o@@ ver@@ -@@ ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ated fol@@ low up to my fre@@ a@@ k@@ is@@ h suc@@ ces@@ s.
And what I have to sort of ke@@ ep tel@@ l@@ ing m@@ y@@ sel@@ f when I get really p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed out about that is don't be af@@ ra@@ i@@ d.
D@@ on@@ 't be da@@ un@@ te@@ d. J@@ ust do your j@@ ob@@ . Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your pi@@ ec@@ e of it, wh@@ ate@@ ver that might b@@ e.
If your jo@@ b is to d@@ an@@ ce, do your d@@ an@@ ce.

J@@ une C@@ o@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ j@@ ect@@ s be@@ fore -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might me@@ an, and di@@ sco@@ ver@@ ing new s@@ et@@ s of gen@@ es.
We@@ 're actually star@@ ting at a new poin@@ t@@ : we've been di@@ g@@ it@@ iz@@ ing bi@@ olog@@ y, and now we're trying to go from that di@@ g@@ it@@ al co@@ de into a new p@@ ha@@ se of bi@@ olog@@ y with desig@@ ning and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing lif@@ e.
So, we've al@@ ways been trying to as@@ k big quest@@ ion@@ s.
"@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" is something that I think many bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s have been trying to underst@@ and at v@@ ari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s.
We@@ 've tri@@ ed v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s.
We@@ 've been di@@ g@@ it@@ iz@@ ing it now for al@@ most 20 year@@ s@@ ;
when we se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce@@ d the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the di@@ g@@ it@@ al world of the com@@ puter@@ .
Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we cre@@ ate new life out of this di@@ g@@ it@@ al uni@@ ver@@ se@@ ?"
This is the ma@@ p of a sm@@ all organ@@ is@@ m, M@@ y@@ co@@ pl@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um, that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a speci@@ es that can self@@ -@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the l@@ abor@@ at@@ or@@ y,
and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ om@@ e.
We@@ 're able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the or@@ der of 1@@ 00 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here@@ .
When we look at its m@@ et@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic ma@@ p@@ , it's rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely sim@@ ple comp@@ are@@ d to our@@ s --
tr@@ ust me, this is sim@@ ple --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a tim@@ e, it's very un@@ lik@@ ely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a li@@ ving c@@ ell@@ .
So we deci@@ ded the only way for@@ war@@ d was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to as@@ k some of these most fund@@ ament@@ al quest@@ ion@@ s.
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of@@ : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e?
C@@ an ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y perm@@ it ma@@ king these really lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es where we've never been be@@ fo@@ re@@ ?
And if we do@@ , can we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e?
A ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e, by the wa@@ y, is just a pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical materi@@ al.
So, our pac@@ e of di@@ g@@ it@@ iz@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ex@@ p@@ on@@ enti@@ al pac@@ e.
O@@ ur abil@@ ity to wr@@ ite the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de has been mo@@ ving pret@@ ty s@@ low@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing,
and our lat@@ est poin@@ t would put it on, no@@ w, an ex@@ p@@ on@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve.
We started this over 1@@ 5 years ag@@ o.
It to@@ ok se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ag@@ es, in fac@@ t, star@@ ting with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ vie@@ w be@@ fore we did the first exper@@ iment@@ s.
But it tur@@ n@@ s out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing D@@ N@@ A is very diff@@ icul@@ t.
There are ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of m@@ ach@@ in@@ es around the world that make sm@@ all pi@@ ec@@ es of D@@ N@@ A -- 3@@ 0 to 50 let@@ ter@@ s in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate proces@@ s, so the l@@ ong@@ er you make the pi@@ ec@@ e, the more er@@ r@@ or@@ s there are.
So we had to cre@@ ate a new me@@ th@@ od for put@@ ting these little pi@@ ec@@ es toge@@ ther and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ r@@ or@@ s.
And this was our first at@@ tem@@ p@@ t, star@@ ting with the di@@ g@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
It's a sm@@ all vir@@ us that k@@ ill@@ s bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
We desig@@ ned the pi@@ ec@@ es, went through our er@@ r@@ or cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a D@@ N@@ A m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s.
The ex@@ cit@@ ing p@@ ha@@ se came when we to@@ ok this pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, and the bac@@ ter@@ ia started to re@@ ad this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de, made the vir@@ al partic@@ l@@ es.
The vir@@ al partic@@ les then were re@@ lea@@ s@@ ed from the c@@ ell@@ s and came back and k@@ ill@@ ed the E@@ . col@@ i.
I was tal@@ king to the o@@ il indu@@ str@@ y rec@@ ent@@ ly and I sai@@ d they c@@ lear@@ ly underst@@ o@@ od that mode@@ l@@ .
They l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed more than you gu@@ ys are.
And so@@ , we think this is a s@@ itu@@ ation where the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can actually buil@@ d its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ olog@@ ical system@@ .
But we wan@@ ted to go much lar@@ g@@ er@@ :
we wan@@ ted to buil@@ d the enti@@ re bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome --
it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de --
so we thought we@@ '@@ d buil@@ d them in cas@@ s@@ et@@ te@@ s the si@@ ze of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the cas@@ s@@ et@@ te@@ s to underst@@ and what the actu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a li@@ ving cel@@ l are.
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n is cr@@ it@@ ic@@ al, and if you're star@@ ting with di@@ g@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation in the com@@ puter@@ , that di@@ g@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate.
When we first se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce@@ d this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , the st@@ and@@ ar@@ d of ac@@ cur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ r@@ or p@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s.
We actually fo@@ un@@ d, on re@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing it, 3@@ 0 er@@ r@@ or@@ s@@ ; had we used that ori@@ gin@@ al se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce, it never would have been able to be bo@@ o@@ ted up@@ .
P@@ ar@@ t of the desig@@ n is desig@@ ning pi@@ ec@@ es that are 50 let@@ ter@@ s l@@ ong that have to o@@ ver@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter pi@@ ec@@ es to buil@@ d sm@@ all@@ er su@@ bun@@ its we have to desig@@ n so they can go toge@@ th@@ er.
We desig@@ n uni@@ qu@@ e el@@ em@@ ents into this.
You may have re@@ ad that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in. Th@@ in@@ k of th@@ is@@ : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- A@@ , C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ et@@ s of those let@@ ter@@ s co@@ de for r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds, s@@ uch that there's a sing@@ le let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ d@@ s.
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de to wr@@ ite out wor@@ ds, s@@ ent@@ en@@ c@@ es, thou@@ ght@@ s.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was au@@ to@@ grap@@ h it.
S@@ ome people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ e@@ tr@@ y.
We desig@@ ned these pi@@ ec@@ es so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es@@ ;
there are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them toge@@ th@@ er.
And we started ma@@ king pi@@ ec@@ es, star@@ ting with pi@@ ec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s, put those toge@@ ther to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter pi@@ ec@@ es, then put s@@ et@@ s of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
A@@ t each st@@ ag@@ e, we gre@@ w up these pi@@ ec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce them because we're trying to cre@@ ate a pro@@ c@@ ess that's ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minu@@ te.
We@@ 're trying to get to the poin@@ t of a@@ ut@@ om@@ ation.
So, this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off@@ .
When we get into these really lar@@ ge pi@@ ec@@ es over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s, they won@@ 't any l@@ ong@@ er gro@@ w read@@ il@@ y in E@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ ha@@ ust@@ s all the mo@@ der@@ n to@@ ol@@ s of m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y --
and so we tur@@ ned to other m@@ ec@@ han@@ is@@ m@@ s.
We k@@ new there's a m@@ ec@@ han@@ is@@ m called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir D@@ N@@ A that can put pi@@ ec@@ es toge@@ th@@ er.
H@@ ere's an exam@@ ple of it@@ :
there's an organ@@ is@@ m called D@@ e@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cu@@ s ra@@ di@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three mil@@ li@@ ons r@@ ad@@ s of ra@@ di@@ ation.
You can see in the to@@ p pan@@ el@@ , its ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome just get@@ s b@@ lo@@ wn ap@@ ar@@ t.
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s lat@@ er, it put it back toge@@ ther ex@@ act@@ ly as it was be@@ fo@@ re.
We have thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of organ@@ is@@ m@@ s that can do this.
Th@@ ese organ@@ is@@ m@@ s can be tot@@ ally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ate@@ d@@ ;
they can li@@ ve in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um@@ .
I am ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely cer@@ ta@@ in that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter sp@@ ac@@ e, mo@@ ve aro@@ un@@ d, find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ .
In fac@@ t, N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out the@@ re.
H@@ ere's an actu@@ al mic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h of the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e we buil@@ t using these proces@@ s@@ es, actually just using y@@ ea@@ st m@@ ec@@ han@@ is@@ m@@ s with the right desig@@ n of the pi@@ ec@@ es we put them in@@ ;
y@@ ea@@ st pu@@ ts them toge@@ ther a@@ ut@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
This is not an electr@@ on mic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h@@ ; this is just a reg@@ ul@@ ar p@@ ho@@ t@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h@@ .
It's s@@ uch a lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e we can see it with a li@@ ght mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e.
Th@@ ese are pic@@ tu@@ res over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ sec@@ ond per@@ io@@ d.
So, this is the publ@@ ic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ or@@ t wh@@ ile ag@@ o.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de@@ ;
it's the lar@@ g@@ est m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e ever made by h@@ um@@ ans of a de@@ fin@@ ed struc@@ tu@@ re.
It's over 3@@ 00 mil@@ lion m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar we@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing, it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ag@@ es just to prin@@ t this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de.
Well, how do we bo@@ o@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e? How do we activ@@ ate th@@ is@@ ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a vir@@ us it's pret@@ ty simpl@@ e@@ ;
it's much more compl@@ ic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a.
It's also simpl@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ te@@ s like our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : you can just po@@ p out the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us and po@@ p in another on@@ e, and that's what you@@ 've all hear@@ d about with cl@@ on@@ ing.
W@@ it@@ h bac@@ ter@@ ia and Ar@@ c@@ ha@@ ea, the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome is inte@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we rec@@ ent@@ ly sho@@ w@@ ed that we can do a compl@@ e@@ te trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one cel@@ l to another and activ@@ ate it.
We p@@ ur@@ i@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al speci@@ es --
r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e,
we di@@ g@@ est@@ ed it with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the prote@@ in@@ s,
and it was pret@@ ty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cel@@ l -- and you@@ 'll ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate our very so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated grap@@ h@@ ic@@ s here@@ . The new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome went into the c@@ ell@@ .
In fac@@ t, we thought this might be as f@@ ar as it w@@ ent, but we tri@@ ed to desig@@ n the pro@@ c@@ ess a little bit fur@@ th@@ er.
This is a maj@@ or m@@ ec@@ han@@ is@@ m of evolu@@ tion right here@@ .
We find all k@@ in@@ ds of speci@@ es that have ta@@ k@@ en up a sec@@ ond ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ wh@@ ere@@ , ad@@ ding thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of new tra@@ its in a sec@@ ond to that speci@@ es.
So, people who think of evolu@@ tion as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y.
There are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es called re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ g@@ est D@@ N@@ A@@ .
The ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome that was in the cel@@ l doesn't have on@@ e@@ ;
the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome we put in do@@ es.
It got ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed and it re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed the other ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome as fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n materi@@ al, ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up@@ , and so we en@@ ded up just with a cel@@ l with the new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ e.
It tur@@ ned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it.
And with a very sh@@ or@@ t per@@ i@@ od of tim@@ e, all the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ic@@ s of one speci@@ es were l@@ ost and it con@@ ver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new speci@@ es bas@@ ed on the new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we put in the c@@ ell@@ .
A@@ ll the prote@@ in@@ s ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d, the mem@@ b@@ ran@@ es ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d@@ ; when we re@@ ad the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de, it's ex@@ act@@ ly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this may so@@ und like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ y, but we can@@ , by mo@@ ving the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are of D@@ N@@ A aro@@ un@@ d, change things qu@@ ite dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
Now I've ar@@ gu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is buil@@ ding on three and a hal@@ f bil@@ lion years of evolu@@ tion. And I've ar@@ gu@@ ed that we're about to per@@ hap@@ s cre@@ ate a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ b@@ ri@@ an expl@@ os@@ ion@@ , where there's ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve new speci@@ ation bas@@ ed on this di@@ g@@ it@@ al desig@@ n@@ .
Wh@@ y do th@@ is@@ ?
I think this is pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ m@@ s of some of the ne@@ ed@@ s.
We@@ 're about to go from si@@ x and a hal@@ f to n@@ ine bil@@ lion people over the next 4@@ 0 year@@ s.
T@@ o put it in con@@ tex@@ t for m@@ y@@ self@@ : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the plan@@ et for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 year@@ s, there@@ 'll be f@@ our@@ .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, pro@@ vi@@ ding fre@@ sh@@ , cl@@ ean wat@@ er, medic@@ in@@ es, f@@ u@@ el for the si@@ x and a hal@@ f bil@@ li@@ on.
It's going to be a st@@ re@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ in@@ e.
We use over fi@@ ve bil@@ lion t@@ ons of co@@ al, 3@@ 0 bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us b@@ ar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il --
that's a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d mil@@ lion b@@ ar@@ rel@@ s a da@@ y.
When we try to think of bi@@ olog@@ ical proces@@ s@@ es or any pro@@ c@@ ess to re@@ place that, it's going to be a hu@@ ge ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
Th@@ en of cour@@ se, there's all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this materi@@ al that en@@ ds up in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ .
We no@@ w, from our di@@ sco@@ very around the worl@@ d, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 mil@@ lion gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the desig@@ n comp@@ on@@ ents of the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
The electr@@ on@@ ic@@ s indu@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ z@@ en or so comp@@ on@@ ent@@ s, and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that.
We@@ 're l@@ imit@@ ed here prim@@ ar@@ il@@ y by a bi@@ olog@@ ical real@@ ity and our imagin@@ ation.
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es, because of these rap@@ id me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
We have the abil@@ ity now to buil@@ d a lar@@ ge robo@@ t that can make a mil@@ lion ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ es a da@@ y.
When you think of proces@@ s@@ ing these 20 mil@@ lion different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ tim@@ iz@@ e proces@@ s@@ es to produc@@ e oc@@ t@@ ane or to produc@@ e ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ ut@@ ic@@ al@@ s, new v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es, we can just with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , do more m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all scien@@ ce.
And it's just st@@ and@@ ar@@ d sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abil@@ ity, ch@@ em@@ ical or f@@ u@@ el produc@@ tion@@ , v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine produc@@ tion@@ , et@@ c@@ .
This is a sc@@ re@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some tr@@ ue desig@@ n so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we're wor@@ king on to actually be able to s@@ it down and desig@@ n speci@@ es in the com@@ puter@@ .
You know, we don't know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y what it@@ 'll look li@@ ke@@ :
we know ex@@ act@@ ly what their gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de loo@@ ks lik@@ e.
We@@ 're fo@@ c@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation f@@ u@@ el@@ s.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en rec@@ ent@@ ly, cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is just a b@@ ad exper@@ iment@@ .
We have sec@@ on@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation f@@ u@@ el@@ s that will be com@@ ing out rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ g@@ ar, to much hi@@ gh@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue f@@ u@@ el@@ s like oc@@ t@@ ane or different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a maj@@ or im@@ p@@ act with@@ out fur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the c@@ ost of fo@@ od and l@@ imit@@ ing its av@@ a@@ il@@ abil@@ ity is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k, and so we're wor@@ king with desig@@ ning c@@ ell@@ s to go down this ro@@ ad@@ . And we think we@@ 'll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation f@@ u@@ el@@ s in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s.
Sun@@ li@@ ght and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our di@@ sco@@ very around the worl@@ d, we have all k@@ in@@ ds of other me@@ th@@ od@@ s.
This is an organ@@ is@@ m we de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed in 19@@ 9@@ 6@@ .
It li@@ ves in the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ an, about a m@@ ile and a hal@@ f de@@ ep@@ , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ wat@@ er tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ s.
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ ane using m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ ar h@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ en as its energ@@ y s@@ our@@ ce.
We@@ 're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2@@ , which can eas@@ il@@ y be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es, con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into f@@ u@@ el to d@@ ri@@ ve this proces@@ s.
So, in a sh@@ or@@ t per@@ i@@ od of tim@@ e, we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic quest@@ ion is of "@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?"
We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ des@@ t go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the wh@@ ole pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ical indu@@ str@@ y --
Y@@ ea@@ h@@ . If you can't do that at TE@@ D@@ , where can you@@ ? --
bec@@ ome a maj@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of energ@@ y ...
But al@@ so@@ , we're now wor@@ king on using these same to@@ ol@@ s to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ et@@ s of v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es.
Y@@ ou@@ 've se@@ en this y@@ ear with f@@ lu@@ ; we're al@@ ways a y@@ ear be@@ h@@ ind and a dol@@ l@@ ar sh@@ or@@ t when it com@@ es to the right v@@ ac@@ cin@@ e.
I think that can be chang@@ ed by buil@@ ding com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ v@@ an@@ ce.
H@@ ere's what the f@@ ut@@ ure may be@@ g@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing, no@@ w, the evolu@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e, sp@@ e@@ e@@ ding up evolu@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic bac@@ ter@@ i@@ a, Ar@@ c@@ ha@@ ea an@@ d, ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally, e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ te@@ s.
We@@ 're a ways a@@ way from im@@ pro@@ ving peopl@@ e:
our go@@ al is just to make sur@@ e that we have a ch@@ ance to sur@@ vi@@ ve l@@ ong en@@ ough to ma@@ ybe do that. Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
What I'm going to show you fir@@ st@@ , as qu@@ ick@@ ly as I can@@ , is some fo@@ und@@ ation@@ al wor@@ k, some new technolog@@ y that we br@@ ou@@ ght to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t as part of an ac@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ on al@@ most ex@@ act@@ ly a y@@ ear ag@@ o. This is S@@ ea@@ dr@@ ag@@ on, and it's an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment
in which you can ei@@ ther loc@@ ally or re@@ mo@@ tel@@ y inter@@ act with v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of vis@@ u@@ al dat@@ a.
We@@ 're looking at man@@ y, many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ te@@ s of di@@ g@@ it@@ al p@@ ho@@ to@@ s here and kind of seam@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and continu@@ ous@@ ly z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, pan@@ ning through it, re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we wan@@ t.
And it doesn't mat@@ ter how much inform@@ ation we're looking at, how big these col@@ l@@ ec@@ tions are or how big the imag@@ es are.
M@@ ost of them are ordin@@ ary di@@ g@@ it@@ al cam@@ era p@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ , but this on@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, is a sc@@ an from the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of C@@ ong@@ res@@ s, and it's in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any differen@@ ce because the only thing that ou@@ ght to l@@ im@@ it the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a syst@@ em like this one is the num@@ ber of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your sc@@ re@@ en at any gi@@ ven mom@@ ent. It's also very fl@@ ex@@ i@@ ble ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
This is an enti@@ re bo@@ o@@ k, so this is an exam@@ ple of n@@ on@@ -@@ imag@@ e dat@@ a.
This is "@@ B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a c@@ hap@@ ter@@ .
T@@ o pro@@ ve to you that it's really tex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so@@ , to really show that this is a real re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the tex@@ t@@ ; it's not a pic@@ tu@@ re.
M@@ a@@ ybe this is an ar@@ ti@@ f@@ ici@@ al way to re@@ ad an e-@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
I w@@ oul@@ dn't re@@ com@@ men@@ d it.
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic cas@@ e, an is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
E@@ very lar@@ ge imag@@ e is the be@@ gin@@ ning of a sec@@ tion.
And this really gi@@ ves you the jo@@ y and the good experien@@ ce of read@@ ing the real p@@ ap@@ er ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er, which is an in@@ h@@ eren@@ t@@ ly mul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of medi@@ um@@ .
We@@ 've d@@ one something with the cor@@ ne@@ r of this partic@@ ul@@ ar is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.
We@@ 've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very hi@@ gh res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion -- much hi@@ gh@@ er than in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ t@@ ent.
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of this car@@ , you can see it here@@ .
O@@ r other mode@@ l@@ s, or even techn@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ation@@ s.
And this really get@@ s at some of these ide@@ as about really doing a@@ way with those l@@ im@@ its on sc@@ re@@ en real est@@ ate.
We ho@@ pe that this me@@ ans no more po@@ p@@ -@@ up@@ s and other r@@ ub@@ b@@ is@@ h like that -- sh@@ oul@@ dn't be nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ f cour@@ se, ma@@ p@@ p@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous ap@@ plic@@ ations for a technolog@@ y like this.
And this one I really won@@ 't sp@@ end any time on, ex@@ cep@@ t to say that we have things to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to this fi@@ el@@ d as w@@ ell@@ .
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . su@@ per@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on to@@ p of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ p@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So let@@ 's pul@@ l up@@ , no@@ w, something el@@ s@@ e.
This is actually li@@ ve on the We@@ b no@@ w@@ ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it ou@@ t.
This is a pro@@ j@@ ect called P@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different techn@@ ologi@@ es. O@@ ne of them is S@@ ea@@ dr@@ ag@@ on and the other is some very b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful com@@ puter@@ -@@ vis@@ ion re@@ sear@@ ch d@@ one by No@@ a@@ h S@@ n@@ av@@ el@@ y, a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate stu@@ dent at the U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ e@@ it@@ z at U@@ .@@ W@@ .
and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ . A very n@@ ice col@@ l@@ abor@@ ation.
And so this is li@@ ve on the We@@ b@@ . It's pow@@ ere@@ d by S@@ ea@@ dr@@ ag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ w@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of mul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ u@@ tion experien@@ ce.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ r@@ ang@@ em@@ ent of the imag@@ es here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ f@@ ul.
The com@@ pute@@ r vis@@ ion al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m@@ s have reg@@ ist@@ ere@@ d these imag@@ es toge@@ ther so that they cor@@ resp@@ ond to the real sp@@ ace in which these sho@@ ts -- all ta@@ k@@ en n@@ ear G@@ r@@ as@@ si L@@ a@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es -- all these sho@@ ts were ta@@ k@@ en@@ . So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ abil@@ iz@@ ed s@@ li@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ all@@ y.
I'm not sur@@ e if I have time to show you any other en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s.
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to j@@ um@@ p str@@ ai@@ ght to one of No@@ a@@ h@@ 's ori@@ gin@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ et@@ s -- this is from an ear@@ ly pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe that we first got wor@@ king this sum@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the punc@@ h l@@ ine be@@ h@@ ind the P@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technolog@@ y, It's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y so ap@@ p@@ aren@@ t from looking at the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s we've put up on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e. We had to wor@@ r@@ y about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ constr@@ uc@@ tion of No@@ tre D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al
that was d@@ one enti@@ re@@ ly com@@ put@@ ation@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ . You just t@@ y@@ pe No@@ tre D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ , and you get some pic@@ tu@@ res of gu@@ ys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t@@ s, and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on. And each of these or@@ ang@@ e con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an imag@@ e that was di@@ sco@@ ve@@ red to bel@@ ong to this mode@@ l@@ .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r imag@@ es, and they@@ 've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this wa@@ y.
We can just n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very sim@@ ple wa@@ y.
You know, I never thought that I'@@ d end up wor@@ king at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t. It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of re@@ cep@@ tion here@@ .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lo@@ ts of different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as@@ : it's every@@ thing from c@@ ell@@ -@@ ph@@ one cam@@ er@@ as to profes@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, qu@@ ite a lar@@ ge num@@ ber of the@@ m, st@@ it@@ ch@@ ed toge@@ ther in this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ir@@ d on@@ es --
So many of them are oc@@ cl@@ u@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
S@@ om@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ i@@ es of p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ s -- here we go@@ .
This is actually a po@@ st@@ er of No@@ tre D@@ ame that reg@@ ist@@ ere@@ d cor@@ rec@@ t@@ l@@ y.
We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ st@@ er to a ph@@ ys@@ ical vie@@ w of this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ .
What the poin@@ t here really is is that we can do things with the soci@@ al en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ . This is now ta@@ king data from every@@ body -- from the enti@@ re col@@ l@@ ec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y, vis@@ u@@ ally, of what the E@@ ar@@ th loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that toge@@ th@@ er. Th@@ ose p@@ ho@@ to@@ s bec@@ ome lin@@ ke@@ d, and they make something em@@ er@@ g@@ ent that's gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s.
You have a mode@@ l that em@@ er@@ g@@ es of the enti@@ re E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the l@@ ong ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ er@@ 's V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al E@@ ar@@ th wor@@ k.
And this is something that gro@@ ws in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it, and wh@@ ose b@@ en@@ ef@@ its bec@@ ome gre@@ at@@ er to the us@@ ers as they use it.
Th@@ e@@ ir own p@@ ho@@ to@@ s are get@@ ting t@@ ag@@ g@@ ed with m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ data that some@@ body el@@ se en@@ te@@ re@@ d.
If some@@ body bo@@ the@@ red to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are, then my p@@ ho@@ to of No@@ tre D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al su@@ d@@ den@@ ly get@@ s en@@ r@@ ic@@ h@@ ed with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an en@@ try poin@@ t to di@@ ve into that sp@@ ac@@ e, into that m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ vers@@ e, using every@@ body el@@ se@@ 's p@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ , and do a kind of a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ mod@@ al and cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er soci@@ al experien@@ ce that wa@@ y.
And of cour@@ se, a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tu@@ al mode@@ l@@ s of every interest@@ ing part of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ , col@@ l@@ ec@@ ted not just from o@@ ver@@ hea@@ d f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite imag@@ es and so on, but from the col@@ l@@ ec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y.
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : D@@ o I underst@@ and this ri@@ ght@@ ? What your so@@ f@@ tw@@ are is going to al@@ lo@@ w, is that at some poin@@ t, really with@@ in the next few year@@ s, all the pic@@ tu@@ res that are s@@ ha@@ red by any@@ one ac@@ ros@@ s the world are going to lin@@ k toge@@ th@@ er@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A@@ : Y@@ es. What this is really doing is di@@ sco@@ ver@@ ing,
cre@@ ating h@@ y@@ per@@ lin@@ k@@ s, if you w@@ ill@@ , between imag@@ es.
It's doing that bas@@ ed on the con@@ t@@ ent in@@ side the imag@@ es.
And that get@@ s really ex@@ cit@@ ing when you think about the r@@ ic@@ hn@@ ess of the sem@@ an@@ tic inform@@ ation a lot of imag@@ es ha@@ ve.
L@@ i@@ ke when you do a we@@ b sear@@ ch for imag@@ es, you t@@ y@@ pe in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es, and the tex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of inform@@ ation about what that pic@@ ture is of@@ .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tu@@ res@@ ?
The am@@ oun@@ t of sem@@ an@@ tic inter@@ con@@ nec@@ tion and r@@ ic@@ hn@@ ess that com@@ es out of that is really hu@@ g@@ e.
It's a clas@@ si@@ c n@@ et@@ work eff@@ ec@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : T@@ r@@ ul@@ y incredi@@ bl@@ e. Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ation@@ s.
You know, one of the in@@ ten@@ se pl@@ ea@@ su@@ res of tr@@ ave@@ l and one of the de@@ li@@ gh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ grap@@ hi@@ c re@@ sear@@ ch is the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity to li@@ ve am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ go@@ t@@ ten the old wa@@ y@@ s, who still fe@@ el their p@@ ast in the w@@ in@@ d, t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ on@@ es pol@@ is@@ h@@ ed by ra@@ in, t@@ ast@@ e it in the b@@ it@@ ter lea@@ ves of pl@@ ant@@ s.
J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ ond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the m@@ y@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ der@@ s still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a, the B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist@@ s still p@@ ur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really re@@ mem@@ ber the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we li@@ ve does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ solu@@ te sen@@ se, but is just one mode@@ l of real@@ ity,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce of one partic@@ ul@@ ar se@@ t of ad@@ ap@@ tive ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ ea@@ ge ma@@ de, al@@ be@@ it suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly, many gener@@ ations ag@@ o.
And of cour@@ se, we all sh@@ are the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ v@@ es.
We@@ 're all bor@@ n@@ . We all br@@ ing our childre@@ n into the worl@@ d.
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation r@@ it@@ es.
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ a@@ th@@ , so it sh@@ oul@@ dn't sur@@ pr@@ ise us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ an@@ ce, we all have ar@@ t.
But wh@@ at's interest@@ ing is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ ad@@ en@@ ce of the son@@ g@@ , the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ tu@@ re.
And wh@@ e@@ ther it is the Pen@@ an in the fo@@ rest@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o acol@@ y@@ te@@ s in H@@ a@@ it@@ i, or the war@@ ri@@ or@@ s in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ er@@ t of N@@ or@@ th@@ er@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ s of the An@@ de@@ s, or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ ai in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a --
this is in@@ ci@@ dent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ er@@ t with a mon@@ th ag@@ o -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k h@@ er@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ , E@@ ve@@ rest@@ , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mo@@ ther of the worl@@ d.
A@@ ll of these peopl@@ es te@@ ach us that there are other ways of be@@ ing, other ways of thin@@ k@@ ing, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing you@@ r@@ sel@@ f in the E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
And this is an ide@@ a, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with ho@@ p@@ e.
Now, toge@@ ther the m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ res of the world make up a we@@ b of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the plan@@ et, and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ olog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ .
And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ gh@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s, m@@ y@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as@@ , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation@@ s, in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ons br@@ ou@@ ght into being by the human imagin@@ ation sin@@ ce the da@@ wn of con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ es@@ s.
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere is h@@ uman@@ it@@ y@@ 's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ iti@@ ve speci@@ es.
And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been se@@ ve@@ re@@ ly er@@ o@@ de@@ d, so to@@ o is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere -- an@@ d, if any@@ thing@@ , at a f@@ ar gre@@ at@@ er r@@ ate.
N@@ o bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s, for exam@@ pl@@ e, would d@@ are su@@ gg@@ est that 50 percent of all speci@@ es or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simpl@@ y is not tr@@ u@@ e, and y@@ et that -- the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of bi@@ olog@@ ical di@@ vers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ cel@@ y ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity.
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that, of cour@@ se, is l@@ ang@@ u@@ age l@@ os@@ s.
When each of you in this ro@@ om were bor@@ n@@ , there were 6@@ ,000 l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ k@@ en on the plan@@ et.
Now, a l@@ ang@@ u@@ age is not just a body of vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a se@@ t of gr@@ am@@ mat@@ ical r@@ ul@@ es.
A l@@ ang@@ u@@ age is a fl@@ as@@ h of the human sp@@ ir@@ it.
It's a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each partic@@ ul@@ ar cul@@ ture com@@ es into the materi@@ al worl@@ d.
E@@ very l@@ ang@@ u@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ th fo@@ res@@ t of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thou@@ ght, an ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em of sp@@ ir@@ itu@@ al possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es.
And of those 6@@ ,000 l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ es, as we s@@ it here to@@ day in M@@ on@@ te@@ re@@ y, ful@@ ly hal@@ f are no l@@ ong@@ er being wh@@ i@@ sp@@ ere@@ d into the ear@@ s of childre@@ n@@ .
Th@@ ey@@ 're no l@@ ong@@ er being ta@@ u@@ ght to b@@ ab@@ i@@ es, which me@@ an@@ s, eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y, un@@ less something chang@@ es, they're al@@ read@@ y de@@ ad@@ .
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ en@@ ce, to be the last of your people to sp@@ ea@@ k your l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ do@@ m of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ or@@ s or ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ate the pr@@ om@@ ise of the childre@@ n@@ ?
And y@@ et, that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the pl@@ i@@ ght of some@@ body some@@ where on E@@ ar@@ th r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ e@@ k@@ s, because every two we@@ e@@ k@@ s, some el@@ der di@@ es and car@@ ri@@ es with hi@@ m into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "@@ Well, w@@ oul@@ dn't it be bet@@ ter@@ ,
w@@ oul@@ dn't the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e@@ ?" And I say, "@@ G@@ re@@ at, let@@ 's make that l@@ ang@@ u@@ age Y@@ or@@ ub@@ a. L@@ et@@ 's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
L@@ et@@ 's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you@@ 'll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly di@@ sco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to sp@@ ea@@ k your own l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
And so@@ , what I'@@ d like to do with you to@@ day is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ , a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ , to try to be@@ g@@ in to give you a sen@@ se of what in fac@@ t is being lo@@ st@@ .
Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing@@ ," I really do m@@ ean different ways of be@@ ing.
T@@ a@@ k@@ e, for exam@@ pl@@ e, this chil@@ d of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who belie@@ ve that m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the ea@@ st in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ a@@ k@@ es.
Now, this is a people who co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ ven@@ s is e@@ qu@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fo@@ res@@ t up@@ on which the people de@@ pen@@ d.
They have a cur@@ i@@ ous l@@ ang@@ u@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age r@@ ul@@ e which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ o@@ g@@ am@@ y@@ :@@ " you m@@ ust mar@@ r@@ y some@@ one who sp@@ ea@@ ks a different l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
And this is all ro@@ o@@ ted in the m@@ y@@ th@@ olog@@ ical p@@ ast@@ , y@@ et the cur@@ i@@ ous thing is in these l@@ ong h@@ ous@@ es, where there are si@@ x or se@@ ven l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ k@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ e, you never h@@ ear any@@ one pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e.
They simpl@@ y li@@ st@@ en and then be@@ g@@ in to sp@@ ea@@ k.
O@@ r@@ , one of the most f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or, an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing people first con@@ t@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , fi@@ ve mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es at@@ tem@@ p@@ ted con@@ t@@ act and made a cr@@ it@@ ical m@@ ist@@ a@@ k@@ e.
They dro@@ p@@ p@@ ed from the a@@ ir 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ s of the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves in what we would say to be fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly g@@ est@@ u@@ re@@ s, for@@ get@@ ting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fo@@ res@@ t had never se@@ en any@@ thing tw@@ o@@ -@@ d@@ imen@@ sion@@ al in their li@@ v@@ es.
They pic@@ ked up these p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h@@ s from the fo@@ res@@ t f@@ lo@@ or, tri@@ ed to look be@@ h@@ ind the face to find the for@@ m or the fi@@ gu@@ re, found no@@ thing@@ , and con@@ cl@@ u@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the dev@@ il@@ , so they sp@@ ea@@ red the fi@@ ve mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es to de@@ a@@ th@@ .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn't just sp@@ ear out@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They sp@@ ea@@ red each oth@@ er.
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each oth@@ er.
We tr@@ ac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back ei@@ ght gener@@ ation@@ s, and we found two inst@@ an@@ ces of natur@@ al de@@ at@@ h and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ low@@ s had go@@ t@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed get@@ ting ol@@ d, so we sp@@ ea@@ red hi@@ m any@@ wa@@ y. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the fo@@ res@@ t that was ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing.
Th@@ e@@ ir h@@ un@@ ter@@ s could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 pac@@ es and tell you what speci@@ es le@@ f@@ t it be@@ h@@ in@@ d.
In the ear@@ ly '@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing as@@ sig@@ n@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i, in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es which were the fo@@ und@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ ier@@ 's st@@ ren@@ g@@ th and T@@ on@@ t@@ on M@@ ac@@ ou@@ te@@ s, and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In or@@ der to make sen@@ se out of sen@@ s@@ ation, of cour@@ se, I had to underst@@ and something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ do@@ un@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ac@@ k ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t.
O@@ n the contr@@ ar@@ y, it's a compl@@ e@@ x m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ys@@ ical worl@@ d@@ vie@@ w.
It's interest@@ ing.
If I as@@ ked you to n@@ ame the great re@@ li@@ gi@@ ons of the worl@@ d, what would you sa@@ y@@ ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ an@@ ity, I@@ s@@ l@@ am@@ , B@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ is@@ m, J@@ u@@ da@@ is@@ m, wh@@ ate@@ ver@@ .
Th@@ ere's al@@ ways one contin@@ ent le@@ f@@ t ou@@ t, the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afr@@ ica had no re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous bel@@ i@@ ef@@ s. Well, of cour@@ se, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simpl@@ y the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very pro@@ found re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous ide@@ as that came over dur@@ ing the tr@@ ag@@ ic D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a.
B@@ ut@@ , what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interest@@ ing is that it's this li@@ ving rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the li@@ ving and the de@@ ad@@ .
So, the li@@ ving give bi@@ r@@ th to the sp@@ ir@@ it@@ s.
The sp@@ ir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from b@@ en@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ at@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ il@@ y dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the li@@ v@@ ing, so that for that b@@ ri@@ e@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing mom@@ ent, the acol@@ y@@ te bec@@ om@@ es the go@@ d.
That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that "@@ You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and sp@@ ea@@ k about G@@ o@@ d.
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and bec@@ ome G@@ od@@ ."
And because you are pos@@ s@@ es@@ se@@ d, you are ta@@ k@@ en by the sp@@ ir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ me@@ d@@ ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation@@ s@@ : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o acol@@ y@@ te@@ s in a st@@ ate of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ l@@ ing bur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with im@@ pun@@ ity, a ra@@ ther ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the abil@@ ity of the min@@ d to a@@ ff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the st@@ ate of ex@@ tre@@ me ex@@ cit@@ ation.
Now, of all the peopl@@ es that I've ever been with@@ , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the S@@ ier@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ ta in nor@@ th@@ er@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
D@@ es@@ cen@@ d@@ ant@@ s of the an@@ ci@@ ent T@@ a@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ v@@ iliz@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ b@@ ean co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ quest@@ , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic ma@@ s@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ b@@ ean co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed contin@@ ent, these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ ere@@ d by the S@@ pan@@ is@@ h@@ .
T@@ o this day, they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a r@@ itu@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tr@@ ain@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y.
The y@@ oun@@ g acol@@ y@@ te@@ s are ta@@ k@@ en a@@ way from their famil@@ i@@ es at the age of three and f@@ our@@ , se@@ quest@@ ere@@ d in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of d@@ ar@@ k@@ n@@ ess in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 year@@ s@@ :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ y@@ ear per@@ io@@ ds de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s of g@@ est@@ ation they sp@@ end in their natur@@ al mo@@ th@@ er@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ th@@ er.
And for this enti@@ re tim@@ e, they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their societ@@ y, val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the pro@@ pos@@ iti@@ on that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the c@@ os@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- b@@ al@@ an@@ ce.
And at the end of this a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing in@@ iti@@ ation, one day they're su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ta@@ k@@ en out and for the first time in their li@@ v@@ es, at the age of 1@@ 8@@ , they see a sun@@ ris@@ e. And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al mom@@ ent of a@@ w@@ aren@@ ess of first li@@ ght as the S@@ un be@@ gin@@ s to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, su@@ d@@ den@@ ly every@@ thing they have lear@@ ned in the ab@@ str@@ act is af@@ fir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ You se@@ e? It's really as I've t@@ old you.
It is that b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ f@@ ul. It is you@@ r@@ s to prote@@ c@@ t@@ ."
They c@@ all the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves the "@@ el@@ der b@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ s@@ " and they say w@@ e, who are the y@@ oun@@ g@@ er b@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ s, are the on@@ es respon@@ si@@ ble for dest@@ ro@@ ying the worl@@ d.
Now, this le@@ ve@@ l of in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on bec@@ om@@ es very importan@@ t.
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ sea@@ u and the old can@@ ar@@ d of the "@@ no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ ag@@ e@@ ," which is an idea r@@ ac@@ ist in its simpl@@ ic@@ ity, or al@@ tern@@ ati@@ vel@@ y, we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ o@@ re@@ au and say these people are cl@@ os@@ er to the E@@ ar@@ th than we are.
Well, indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther s@@ ent@@ iment@@ al n@@ or w@@ ea@@ k@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
Th@@ ere's not a lot of ro@@ om for ei@@ ther in the m@@ al@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ p@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing w@@ in@@ ds of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , but they ha@@ ve, ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ es@@ s, through time and r@@ itu@@ al, for@@ g@@ ed a tr@@ ad@@ iti@@ on@@ al m@@ y@@ st@@ i@@ qu@@ e of the E@@ ar@@ th that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being self@@ -@@ con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous@@ ly cl@@ ose to it, but on a f@@ ar sub@@ t@@ l@@ er in@@ tu@@ iti@@ on@@ : the idea that the E@@ ar@@ th it@@ sel@@ f can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ the@@ d into being by human con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ es@@ s.
Now, what does that me@@ an@@ ?
It me@@ ans that a y@@ oun@@ g ki@@ d from the An@@ de@@ s wh@@ o@@ 's ra@@ is@@ ed to belie@@ ve that that mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a y@@ oun@@ g ki@@ d from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to belie@@ ve that a mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is a p@@ ile of ro@@ c@@ k read@@ y to be min@@ ed.
Wh@@ e@@ ther it's the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ re@@ le@@ v@@ an@@ t.
Wh@@ at's interest@@ ing is the m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al and the natur@@ al worl@@ d.
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the fo@@ rest@@ s of B@@ r@@ it@@ is@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to belie@@ ve those fo@@ rest@@ s exist@@ ed to be cu@@ t.
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ en@@ ds am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who belie@@ ve that those fo@@ rest@@ s were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al sp@@ ir@@ its that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the worl@@ d, sp@@ ir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age dur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation.
Now, if you be@@ g@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tu@@ res could cre@@ ate different real@@ iti@@ es, you could be@@ g@@ in to underst@@ and some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary di@@ sco@@ ver@@ i@@ es. T@@ a@@ ke this pl@@ ant here@@ .
It's a p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h I to@@ ok in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pr@@ il@@ .
This is a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a, which many of you have hear@@ d ab@@ ou@@ t, the most pow@@ er@@ ful p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What ma@@ kes a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ olog@@ ical po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation, but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different s@@ our@@ ces@@ :
on the one han@@ d, this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ i@@ es of bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ m@@ al@@ in@@ e, mil@@ d@@ ly hal@@ luc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke d@@ ri@@ f@@ t ac@@ ros@@ s your con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess -- but it's mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ r@@ u@@ b in the co@@ f@@ fe@@ e famil@@ y called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ tr@@ ia vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s.
This pl@@ ant had in it some very pow@@ er@@ ful tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es, very cl@@ ose to bra@@ in ser@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ in, d@@ im@@ e@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e, 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ d@@ im@@ e@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e.
If you@@ 've ever se@@ en the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ low@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ f@@ f up their n@@ os@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different se@@ t of speci@@ es also con@@ ta@@ in@@ s me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ d@@ im@@ e@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e.
T@@ o have that pow@@ der b@@ lo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is ra@@ ther like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le b@@ ar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ qu@@ e p@@ ain@@ t@@ ing@@ s and l@@ and@@ ing on a s@@ ea of electr@@ ic@@ ity. It doesn't cre@@ ate the dist@@ or@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ at@@ es the dis@@ solu@@ tion of real@@ ity.
In fac@@ t, I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or, R@@ ic@@ har@@ d E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ul@@ te@@ s -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e@@ de@@ li@@ c era with his di@@ sco@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s --
I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you c@@ oul@@ dn't clas@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es as hal@@ luc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're un@@ der the eff@@ ect@@ s there's no one h@@ ome any@@ more to experien@@ ce a hal@@ luc@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ es is they can@@ not be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally because they're den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ as@@ e.
They can only be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally if ta@@ k@@ en in con@@ j@@ unc@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ical that den@@ at@@ u@@ res the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es found with@@ in that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ or@@ s of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ in@@ e. So you as@@ k you@@ r@@ sel@@ f a quest@@ ion@@ . Ho@@ w, in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 speci@@ es of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar pl@@ ant@@ s, do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated pl@@ ant@@ s that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this wa@@ y, cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the wh@@ ole being gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s@@ ?
Well, we use that great e@@ up@@ h@@ em@@ is@@ m, "@@ tri@@ al and er@@ r@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ l@@ es@@ s.
But you as@@ k the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "@@ The pl@@ ant@@ s talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that me@@ an@@ ?
This tri@@ b@@ e, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ti@@ es of a@@ y@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a, all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h a great dist@@ ance in the fo@@ rest@@ , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one speci@@ es.
And then you as@@ k them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h their ta@@ x@@ onom@@ y and they say, "@@ I thought you k@@ new something about pl@@ ant@@ s.
I me@@ an, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ti@@ es in the ni@@ ght of a ful@@ l mo@@ on, and it sing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interest@@ ing than coun@@ ting st@@ amen@@ s.
Now -- -- the prob@@ le@@ m -- the prob@@ le@@ m is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the pl@@ i@@ ght of indi@@ gen@@ ous people vie@@ w them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ du@@ ce@@ d to the mar@@ gin@@ s of h@@ ist@@ ory as the real worl@@ d, me@@ an@@ ing our worl@@ d, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y, 3@@ 00 years from no@@ w, is not going to be re@@ mem@@ b@@ ere@@ d for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical in@@ no@@ v@@ ation@@ s, but ra@@ ther as the era in which we st@@ o@@ od by and ei@@ ther activ@@ ely en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed or pas@@ si@@ v@@ ely ac@@ cep@@ ted the ma@@ s@@ si@@ ve de@@ struc@@ tion of bo@@ th bi@@ olog@@ ical and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity on the plan@@ et. Now, the prob@@ le@@ m is@@ n't chang@@ e.
A@@ ll cul@@ tu@@ res through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es of lif@@ e.
And the prob@@ le@@ m is not technolog@@ y it@@ self@@ .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not st@@ o@@ p being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they ga@@ ve up the bo@@ w and ar@@ ro@@ w any more than an Americ@@ an st@@ op@@ p@@ ed being an Americ@@ an when he ga@@ ve up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y.
It's not change or technolog@@ y that thre@@ at@@ en@@ s the inte@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere@@ . It is pow@@ er,
the cr@@ u@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation.
Wh@@ ere@@ ver you look around the worl@@ d, you di@@ sco@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tu@@ res dest@@ in@@ ed to fa@@ de a@@ wa@@ y@@ ;
these are d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic li@@ ving peopl@@ es being d@@ ri@@ ven out of exist@@ en@@ ce by i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ ond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to@@ :
wh@@ e@@ ther it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved fre@@ e in the fo@@ res@@ t un@@ ti@@ l a gener@@ ation ag@@ o, and now have all been re@@ du@@ ce@@ d to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the ri@@ ver it@@ sel@@ f is so@@ il@@ ed with the s@@ il@@ t that se@@ em@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying hal@@ f of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o a@@ way to the S@@ ou@@ th Ch@@ ina S@@ ea,
where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ i@@ gh@@ ter@@ s han@@ g li@@ ght in the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on read@@ y to f@@ ill their h@@ ol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ g@@ s ri@@ p@@ p@@ ed from the fo@@ res@@ t --
or, in the c@@ ase of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i, it's the di@@ sea@@ se ent@@ iti@@ es that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the di@@ sco@@ very of g@@ ol@@ d.
O@@ r if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ s of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of re@@ sear@@ ch rec@@ ent@@ ly, you@@ 'll see it's a cr@@ u@@ de face of polit@@ ical dom@@ in@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, the ph@@ ys@@ ical ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de, the de@@ struc@@ tion of peopl@@ e's way of lif@@ e, is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, it's univers@@ ally, in many qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s, cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated as part of a devel@@ op@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.
And you can@@ not underst@@ and the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t un@@ ti@@ l you mo@@ ve through it at the gro@@ und le@@ vel@@ .
I on@@ ce tr@@ av@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ est@@ er@@ n Ch@@ ina o@@ ver@@ l@@ and through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ ha@@ sa with a y@@ oun@@ g col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ sa that I underst@@ o@@ od the face be@@ h@@ ind the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s you h@@ ear ab@@ out@@ :
6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ ar@@ t to d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es,
1@@ .@@ 2 mil@@ lion people k@@ ill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ res dur@@ ing the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evolu@@ tion.
This y@@ oun@@ g man@@ 's fa@@ ther had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ a@@ ma@@ .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ ant@@ ly k@@ ill@@ ed at the time of the Ch@@ in@@ ese inv@@ as@@ ion@@ .
H@@ is unc@@ le fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a that to@@ ok the people to Ne@@ p@@ al.
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cr@@ ime of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.
He was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de b@@ en@@ e@@ at@@ h her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she c@@ oul@@ dn't b@@ ear to be with@@ out h@@ im@@ .
The sist@@ er who had d@@ one that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an educ@@ ation cam@@ p@@ .
O@@ ne day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent@@ ly st@@ ep@@ p@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of M@@ a@@ o, and for that trans@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ on, she was gi@@ ven se@@ ven years of har@@ d l@@ ab@@ or.
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possi@@ ble to be@@ ar, but the re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to be@@ h@@ ol@@ d.
And in the en@@ d, th@@ en, it really com@@ es down to a ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e:
do we want to li@@ ve in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of mon@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ ati@@ c world of di@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ ?
Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t M@@ ea@@ d, the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ ist@@ , said, be@@ fore she di@@ ed, that her gre@@ at@@ est f@@ ear was that as we d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted to@@ war@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world vie@@ w not only would we see the enti@@ re r@@ ang@@ e of the human imagin@@ ation re@@ du@@ ce@@ d to a more n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w mod@@ al@@ ity of thou@@ ght, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day ha@@ ving for@@ go@@ t@@ ten there were even other possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es.
And it's h@@ um@@ bl@@ ing to re@@ mem@@ ber that our speci@@ es ha@@ s, per@@ hap@@ s, been around for [@@ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ] year@@ s.
The Ne@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolu@@ tion -- which ga@@ ve us ag@@ r@@ icul@@ tu@@ re, at which time we suc@@ cum@@ b@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ e@@ try of the s@@ ha@@ man was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we cre@@ ated hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 1@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o.
The mo@@ der@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is b@@ are@@ ly 3@@ 00 years ol@@ d.
Now, that sh@@ al@@ low h@@ ist@@ ory doesn't su@@ gg@@ est to me that we have all the ans@@ w@@ ers for all of the ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ fr@@ on@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ l@@ en@@ ni@@ a.
When these m@@ y@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tu@@ res of the world are as@@ ked the me@@ an@@ ing of being h@@ um@@ an, they resp@@ ond with 1@@ 0@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es.
And it's with@@ in that son@@ g that we will all re@@ di@@ sco@@ ver the possi@@ bil@@ ity of being what we are@@ : a ful@@ ly con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous speci@@ es, ful@@ ly a@@ w@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peopl@@ es and all g@@ ar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ is@@ h@@ . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
This is a p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ h I to@@ ok at the nor@@ th@@ er@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ a@@ ff@@ in I@@ s@@ l@@ and when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it peopl@@ e, and this man@@ , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k, t@@ old me a mar@@ vel@@ ous st@@ ory of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ th@@ er.
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ vern@@ ment has not al@@ ways been kind to the In@@ u@@ it peopl@@ e, and dur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h our so@@ ve@@ re@@ ig@@ n@@ t@@ y, we for@@ ce@@ d them into s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ em@@ ent@@ s.
This old man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to go@@ .
The famil@@ y, fe@@ ar@@ ful for his lif@@ e, to@@ ok a@@ way all of his w@@ ea@@ p@@ on@@ s, all of his to@@ ol@@ s.
Now, you m@@ ust underst@@ and that the In@@ u@@ it did not f@@ ear the col@@ d@@ ; they to@@ ok ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it.
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ le@@ ds were ori@@ gin@@ ally made of f@@ is@@ h wr@@ ap@@ p@@ ed in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou h@@ ide@@ .
So, this man@@ 's gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ tim@@ i@@ dat@@ ed by the Ar@@ c@@ tic ni@@ ght or the bli@@ z@@ z@@ ar@@ d that was b@@ low@@ ing.
He simpl@@ y s@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed out@@ si@@ de, pul@@ l@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ou@@ ser@@ s and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his han@@ d. And as the f@@ ec@@ es be@@ g@@ an to fre@@ ez@@ e, he s@@ hap@@ ed it into the for@@ m of a bl@@ a@@ de.
He put a s@@ pra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ f@@ e and as it fin@@ ally f@@ ro@@ ze sol@@ i@@ d, he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ ere@@ d a do@@ g with it.
He sk@@ in@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ n@@ es@@ s, to@@ ok the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ le@@ d, har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g@@ , and dis@@ ap@@ p@@ ea@@ red over the ice f@@ lo@@ es, sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in bel@@ t.
Talk about get@@ ting by with no@@ thing@@ . And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ il@@ ien@@ ce of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the worl@@ d.

And fin@@ ally, in the en@@ d, I think it's pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous at lea@@ st to all of all us wh@@ o@@ 've tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et, to realiz@@ e that they're not re@@ mo@@ te at all@@ .
Th@@ ey@@ 're h@@ om@@ el@@ an@@ ds of some@@ bo@@ d@@ y.
They re@@ pres@@ ent b@@ ran@@ ch@@ es of the human imagin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of tim@@ e. And for all of us, the dre@@ am@@ s of these childre@@ n@@ , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own childre@@ n@@ , bec@@ ome part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ y of ho@@ p@@ e.
So, what we're trying to do at the N@@ ation@@ al G@@ e@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ic, fin@@ ally, is, we belie@@ ve that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ compl@@ is@@ h any@@ thing@@ .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ic@@ s -- -- we think that pol@@ em@@ ic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve, but we think that st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ing can change the worl@@ d, and so we are probab@@ ly the b@@ est st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ ing inst@@ itu@@ tion
in the worl@@ d. We get 3@@ 5 mil@@ lion h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th@@ .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ r@@ y our tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ion ch@@ an@@ n@@ el@@ .
O@@ ur mag@@ az@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by mil@@ li@@ on@@ s.
And what we're doing is a ser@@ i@@ es of j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ ph@@ ere where we're going to take our au@@ di@@ en@@ ce to plac@@ es of s@@ uch cul@@ tur@@ al won@@ der that they can@@ not hel@@ p but come a@@ way d@@ az@@ z@@ l@@ ed by what they have se@@ en, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, there@@ fo@@ re, em@@ br@@ ace gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ally, one by on@@ e, the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ y@@ : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ ver@@ se wa@@ y, that we can find a way to li@@ ve in a tr@@ ul@@ y mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the w@@ is@@ do@@ m of all peopl@@ es can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to our col@@ l@@ ec@@ tive w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
I'm going to talk to you about some stu@@ f@@ f that's in this bo@@ ok of mine that I ho@@ pe will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you@@ 've al@@ read@@ y hear@@ d, and I'@@ ll try to make some con@@ nec@@ tions m@@ y@@ self@@ , in c@@ ase you mis@@ s@@ ed them.
But I want to start with what I c@@ all the "@@ off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of wh@@ at@@ ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all W@@ est@@ er@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es.
And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ un@@ s like th@@ is@@ : if we are interest@@ ed in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of our cit@@ iz@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .
The reas@@ on for this is bo@@ th that fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is in and of it@@ sel@@ f go@@ o@@ d, val@@ u@@ abl@@ e, wor@@ th@@ wh@@ ile, es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al to being h@@ uman@@ .
And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e our w@@ el@@ f@@ are, and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ hal@@ f@@ .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e ch@@ o@@ ice.
The more ch@@ o@@ ice people ha@@ ve, the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they ha@@ ve, and the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they ha@@ ve, the more w@@ el@@ f@@ are they ha@@ ve.
Th@@ is, I thin@@ k, is so de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the wat@@ er sup@@ pl@@ y that it w@@ oul@@ dn't oc@@ cu@@ r to any@@ one to quest@@ ion it.
And it's also de@@ e@@ pl@@ y em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our li@@ v@@ es.
I'@@ ll give you some exam@@ pl@@ es of what mo@@ der@@ n pro@@ g@@ res@@ s has made possi@@ ble for us.
This is my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et. No@@ t s@@ uch a big on@@ e.
I want to say just a wor@@ d about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing.
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing@@ s in my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in ol@@ i@@ ve o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ s@@ am@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ar@@ s you could bu@@ y to make a very lar@@ ge num@@ ber of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ ch@@ ance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the su@@ per@@ mark@@ et is lik@@ e.
And then you go to the con@@ sum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ic@@ s st@@ ore to se@@ t up a st@@ ere@@ o syst@@ em -- sp@@ ea@@ k@@ er@@ s, C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er, ta@@ pe pla@@ y@@ er, t@@ un@@ er, am@@ pl@@ i@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one sing@@ le con@@ sum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ic@@ s st@@ o@@ re, there are that many st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s.
We can constr@@ uc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ mil@@ lion different st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one st@@ o@@ re.
Y@@ ou@@ 've got to ad@@ m@@ it that's a lot of ch@@ o@@ ice.
In other dom@@ ain@@ s -- the world of commun@@ ic@@ ation@@ s.
There was a tim@@ e, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one serv@@ ice you wan@@ te@@ d, as l@@ ong as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell@@ .
You ren@@ ted your ph@@ on@@ e. You didn't bu@@ y it.
O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce of that, by the wa@@ y, is that the ph@@ one never b@@ ro@@ k@@ e.
And those da@@ ys are g@@ on@@ e.
We now have an al@@ most un@@ l@@ imit@@ ed v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ on@@ es, es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of cel@@ l ph@@ on@@ es.
Th@@ ese are cel@@ l ph@@ on@@ es of the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
M@@ y fa@@ vor@@ ite is the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er, n@@ ose ha@@ ir tr@@ im@@ mer@@ , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch@@ .
And if by some ch@@ ance you ha@@ ven@@ 't se@@ en that in your st@@ ore y@@ et, you can res@@ t as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you w@@ ill@@ .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to w@@ alk into their st@@ o@@ res as@@ king this quest@@ ion@@ .
And do you know what the ans@@ w@@ er to this quest@@ ion now is@@ ?
The ans@@ w@@ er is "@@ no@@ ." It is not possi@@ ble to bu@@ y a cel@@ l ph@@ one that doesn't do to@@ o mu@@ ch@@ .
So, in other as@@ p@@ ect@@ s of life that are much more sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant than bu@@ ying thing@@ s, the same expl@@ os@@ ion of ch@@ o@@ ice is tr@@ u@@ e.
H@@ e@@ al@@ th c@@ are. It is no l@@ ong@@ er the c@@ ase in the Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es that you go to the do@@ c@@ t@@ or, and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or tel@@ l@@ s you what to do@@ .
In@@ st@@ ea@@ d, you go to the do@@ c@@ t@@ or, and the do@@ c@@ t@@ or tel@@ l@@ s you@@ , "@@ Well, we could do A@@ , or we could do B@@ .
A has these b@@ en@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s.
B has these b@@ en@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ k@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?" And the do@@ c sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ A has these b@@ en@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s, and B has these b@@ en@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ k@@ s.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?" And the do@@ c sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ." And the res@@ ul@@ t is -- we c@@ all it "@@ p@@ ati@@ ent a@@ ut@@ onom@@ y@@ ," which ma@@ kes it so@@ und like a good thing@@ ,
but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ de@@ n and the respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity for dec@@ is@@ ion@@ -@@ ma@@ king from some@@ body who kno@@ ws something -- n@@ am@@ el@@ y, the do@@ c@@ t@@ or -- to some@@ body who kno@@ ws no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly s@@ ic@@ k and th@@ us not in the b@@ est s@@ ha@@ pe to be ma@@ king dec@@ is@@ ion@@ s -- n@@ am@@ el@@ y, the p@@ ati@@ ent.
Th@@ ere's en@@ or@@ m@@ ous mark@@ et@@ ing of pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tion dr@@ ug@@ s to people like you and me, wh@@ ic@@ h, if you think about it, ma@@ kes no sen@@ se at all@@ , sin@@ ce we can't bu@@ y them.
Wh@@ y do they mark@@ et to us if we can't bu@@ y the@@ m@@ ?
The ans@@ w@@ er is that they ex@@ p@@ ect us to c@@ all our do@@ c@@ tor@@ s the next mor@@ ning and as@@ k for our pre@@ scri@@ p@@ tions to be ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing as dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c as our i@@ dent@@ ity has now bec@@ ome a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice, as this s@@ li@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate.
We don't in@@ h@@ er@@ it an i@@ dent@@ it@@ y@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ sel@@ ves as of@@ ten as we lik@@ e.
And that me@@ ans that every day, when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ n@@ ing, you have to deci@@ de what kind of per@@ son you want to b@@ e.
W@@ it@@ h re@@ spec@@ t to mar@@ ri@@ age and famil@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d, and then you started ha@@ ving ki@@ ds as so@@ on as you c@@ oul@@ d.
The only real ch@@ o@@ ice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter@@ .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ y@@ s, every@@ thing is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s.
I te@@ ach won@@ der@@ ful@@ ly intel@@ li@@ g@@ ent stu@@ dent@@ s, and I as@@ sig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to@@ .
And it's not because they're less s@@ mar@@ t, and it's not because they're less d@@ il@@ ig@@ ent.
It's because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed, as@@ king the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or no@@ t@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed no@@ w@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed lat@@ er@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I have ki@@ ds fir@@ st@@ , or a care@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?" A@@ ll of these are con@@ sum@@ ing quest@@ ion@@ s.
And they're going to ans@@ w@@ er these quest@@ ion@@ s, wh@@ e@@ ther or not it me@@ ans not doing all the work I as@@ sig@@ n and not get@@ ting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ oul@@ d. Th@@ ese are important quest@@ ion@@ s to ans@@ w@@ er.
W@@ or@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as C@@ ar@@ l was poin@@ ting ou@@ t, with the technolog@@ y that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every minu@@ te of every day from any place on the plan@@ et -- ex@@ cep@@ t the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h Ho@@ tel@@ .
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the wa@@ y, that I'm not going to tell any@@ body ab@@ ou@@ t, where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ k@@ s.
I'm not tel@@ l@@ ing you about it because I want to use it.
So what this me@@ an@@ s, this incredi@@ ble fre@@ e@@ do@@ m of ch@@ o@@ ice we have with re@@ spec@@ t to wor@@ k, is that we have to make a dec@@ is@@ ion@@ , ag@@ a@@ in and ag@@ a@@ in and again@@ , about wh@@ e@@ ther we should or sh@@ oul@@ dn't be wor@@ k@@ ing.
We can go to wat@@ ch our ki@@ d pla@@ y so@@ c@@ cer@@ , and we have our cel@@ l ph@@ one on one hi@@ p@@ , and our B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ ber@@ r@@ y on our other hi@@ p@@ , and our l@@ ap@@ to@@ p@@ , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bl@@ y, on our l@@ ap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every minu@@ te that we're wat@@ ch@@ ing our ki@@ d m@@ ut@@ il@@ ate a so@@ c@@ ce@@ r g@@ am@@ e, we are also as@@ king our@@ sel@@ v@@ es, "@@ S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ w@@ er this cel@@ l ph@@ one call@@ ?
S@@ h@@ ould I resp@@ ond to this e@@ ma@@ il@@ ? S@@ h@@ ould I d@@ ra@@ f@@ t this let@@ ter@@ ?" And even if the ans@@ w@@ er to the quest@@ ion is "@@ no@@ ," it's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the experien@@ ce of your ki@@ d@@ 's so@@ c@@ ce@@ r g@@ ame very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en@@ .
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and sm@@ all thing@@ s, materi@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le thing@@ s, life is a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice.
And the world we used to li@@ ve in loo@@ ked like this.
[@@ Well, actu@@ ally, they are wr@@ it@@ ten in st@@ on@@ e@@ .@@ ] That is to say, there were some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es, but not every@@ thing was a mat@@ ter of ch@@ o@@ ice.
And the world we now li@@ ve in loo@@ ks like this. [@@ The T@@ en C@@ om@@ man@@ d@@ ment@@ s D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it@@ ]
And the quest@@ ion is, is this good ne@@ w@@ s, or b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."
We all know wh@@ at's good about it, so I'm going to talk about wh@@ at's b@@ ad about it.
A@@ ll of this ch@@ o@@ ice has two eff@@ ect@@ s, two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ect@@ s on peopl@@ e.
O@@ ne eff@@ ec@@ t, par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it pro@@ du@@ ces par@@ al@@ ys@@ is, ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation.
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ tions to ch@@ o@@ ose fr@@ om@@ , people find it very diff@@ icul@@ t to ch@@ o@@ ose at all@@ .
I'@@ ll give you one very dr@@ am@@ ati@@ c exam@@ ple of th@@ is@@ : a stu@@ dy that was d@@ one of in@@ vest@@ ment@@ s in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s.
A col@@ lea@@ gu@@ e of mine got ac@@ c@@ ess to in@@ vest@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ ang@@ u@@ ar@@ d, the gi@@ gan@@ tic m@@ ut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und comp@@ any of about a mil@@ lion empl@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ plac@@ es.
And what she found is that for every 10 m@@ ut@@ u@@ al f@@ un@@ ds the empl@@ o@@ y@@ er off@@ ere@@ d, r@@ ate of part@@ ici@@ p@@ ation went down two perc@@ ent.
You off@@ er 50 f@@ un@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er empl@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ es part@@ ici@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ ve. Wh@@ y@@ ?
Because with 50 f@@ un@@ ds to ch@@ o@@ ose fr@@ om@@ , it's so d@@ am@@ n har@@ d to deci@@ de which f@@ und to ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, that you@@ 'll just put it off un@@ ti@@ l t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w.
And then t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w, and of cour@@ se t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ st@@ and that not only does this m@@ ean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g fo@@ od when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have en@@ ough mon@@ ey put a@@ wa@@ y, it also me@@ ans that ma@@ king the dec@@ is@@ ion is so har@@ d that they pas@@ s up sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing mon@@ ey from the empl@@ o@@ y@@ er.
B@@ y not part@@ ici@@ pat@@ ing, they are pas@@ s@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dol@@ lar@@ s a y@@ ear from the empl@@ o@@ y@@ er, who would happ@@ il@@ y mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion.
So par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce of ha@@ ving to@@ o many ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es.
And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this. [@@ And l@@ ast@@ ly, for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity, F@@ ren@@ ch@@ , b@@ le@@ u ch@@ e@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ]
You really want to get the dec@@ is@@ ion right if it's for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity, ri@@ ght@@ ?
You don't want to pic@@ k the wr@@ ong m@@ ut@@ u@@ al f@@ un@@ d, or the wr@@ ong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing.
So that's one eff@@ ec@@ t. The sec@@ ond eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to o@@ ver@@ come the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and make a ch@@ o@@ ice, we end up less s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ul@@ t of the ch@@ o@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ tions to ch@@ o@@ ose fr@@ om@@ .
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons for this.
O@@ ne of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing@@ s to ch@@ o@@ ose fr@@ om@@ , if you bu@@ y on@@ e, and it's not per@@ f@@ ect -- and what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing is@@ ? --
it's eas@@ y to imag@@ ine you could have made a different ch@@ o@@ ice that would have been bet@@ ter@@ . And what happen@@ s is this imagin@@ ed al@@ tern@@ ative indu@@ ces you to re@@ gre@@ t the dec@@ is@@ ion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tr@@ ac@@ ts from the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the dec@@ is@@ ion you ma@@ de, even if it was a good dec@@ is@@ ion@@ .
The more op@@ tions there are, the ea@@ si@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t any@@ thing at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ os@@ e.
S@@ ec@@ on@@ d, what econom@@ ist@@ s c@@ all "@@ op@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ st@@ s@@ ."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big poin@@ t this mor@@ ning of tal@@ king about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things de@@ pen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to@@ .
Well, when there are lo@@ ts of al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der@@ , it is eas@@ y to imag@@ ine the at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of al@@ tern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ j@@ ect that make you less s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ tern@@ ative that you@@ 've ch@@ os@@ en@@ .
H@@ ere's an exam@@ pl@@ e. [@@ I can't st@@ o@@ p thin@@ king about those other av@@ a@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th st@@ re@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ r@@ y if you're not New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er@@ s.
H@@ ere's what you're sup@@ pos@@ ed to be thin@@ k@@ ing.
H@@ ere's this c@@ ou@@ ple on the H@@ am@@ pt@@ on@@ s.
V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve real est@@ ate.
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . B@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful da@@ y. They have it all to the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ? "@@ Well, d@@ am@@ n it@@ ," this gu@@ y is thin@@ k@@ ing,
"@@ It's A@@ u@@ gu@@ st@@ . E@@ very@@ body in my M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is a@@ wa@@ y.
I could be par@@ king right in fr@@ on@@ t of my buil@@ d@@ ing@@ ." And he sp@@ en@@ ds two we@@ e@@ ks n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ s@@ ing the op@@ port@@ un@@ ity, day after day, to have a great par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ e.
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ st@@ s sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, even when what we ch@@ o@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ fic@@ .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der@@ , the more at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ fl@@ ec@@ ted by us as op@@ port@@ un@@ ity co@@ st@@ s.
H@@ ere's another exam@@ pl@@ e.
Now this car@@ to@@ on ma@@ kes a lot of poin@@ t@@ s.
It ma@@ kes poin@@ ts about li@@ ving in the mom@@ ent as w@@ ell, and probab@@ ly about doing things s@@ low@@ l@@ y.
But one poin@@ t it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing one thing@@ , you're ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lo@@ ts of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ s, and it's going to make what you're doing less at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve.
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ cal@@ ation of ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation@@ s.
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ an@@ s.
I w@@ ear j@@ e@@ ans al@@ most all the tim@@ e.
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one fl@@ av@@ or, and you b@@ ou@@ ght the@@ m, and they f@@ it like cr@@ ap@@ , they were incredi@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ abl@@ e, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them en@@ ough tim@@ es, they started to fe@@ el O@@ K@@ .
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old on@@ es, and I said, "@@ I want a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ an@@ s. H@@ ere's my si@@ z@@ e@@ ." And the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said, "@@ D@@ o you want s@@ li@@ m f@@ it, eas@@ y f@@ it, re@@ la@@ x@@ ed f@@ it@@ ?
You want b@@ ut@@ t@@ on f@@ ly or zi@@ p@@ p@@ er fl@@ y@@ ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ was@@ he@@ d@@ ?
D@@ o you want them dist@@ res@@ se@@ d@@ ?
You want bo@@ o@@ t cu@@ t, t@@ ap@@ ere@@ d, bl@@ a@@ h bl@@ a@@ h@@ ." O@@ n and on he w@@ ent.
M@@ y j@@ a@@ w dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ co@@ ve@@ re@@ d, I said, "@@ I want the kind that used to be the only k@@ in@@ d@@ ." He had no idea what that was@@ , so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our trying on all these d@@ am@@ n j@@ e@@ an@@ s, and I w@@ al@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- tr@@ u@@ th@@ ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting j@@ e@@ ans I had ever ha@@ d.
I did bet@@ ter@@ . A@@ ll this ch@@ o@@ ice made it possi@@ ble for me to do bet@@ ter@@ .
But -- I fel@@ t wor@@ s@@ e.
Wh@@ y@@ ? I w@@ ro@@ te a wh@@ ole bo@@ ok to try to expl@@ a@@ in this to m@@ y@@ self@@ .
The reas@@ on -- The reas@@ on I fel@@ t wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tions av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, my ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up@@ .
I had very lo@@ w, no partic@@ ul@@ ar ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or.
When they came in 1@@ 00 fl@@ av@@ or@@ s, d@@ am@@ n it, one of them sh@@ oul@@ d@@ 've been per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And what I got was go@@ o@@ d, but it was@@ n't per@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
And so I comp@@ are@@ d what I got to what I ex@@ p@@ ec@@ te@@ d, and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I ex@@ p@@ ec@@ te@@ d.
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to peopl@@ e's li@@ ves can't hel@@ p but incre@@ ase the ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will b@@ e.
And what that's going to produc@@ e is less s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ul@@ t@@ s, even when they're good res@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ et@@ ing kno@@ ws this.
[@@ It all loo@@ ks so gre@@ at. I can't wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ po@@ inte@@ d@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you w@@ oul@@ dn't all know what this was ab@@ ou@@ t.
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this.
[@@ E@@ very@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se@@ ] The reas@@ on that every@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se is that when every@@ thing was wor@@ se, it was actually possi@@ ble for people to have experien@@ ces that were a pl@@ eas@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ a@@ y@@ s, the world we li@@ ve in -- we a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent, indu@@ stri@@ aliz@@ ed cit@@ iz@@ en@@ s, with per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion the ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation -- the b@@ est you can ever ho@@ pe for is that stu@@ f@@ f is as good as you ex@@ p@@ ect it to b@@ e.
You will never be pl@@ eas@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ed because your ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation@@ s, my ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation@@ s, have g@@ one through the ro@@ of@@ .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess is low ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation@@ s.
[@@ Y@@ ou@@ 'll do@@ ] I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ o@@ grap@@ h@@ ical mom@@ ent -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ f@@ e, and sh@@ e's really qu@@ ite won@@ der@@ f@@ ul.
I c@@ oul@@ dn't have d@@ one bet@@ ter@@ .
I didn't s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ e. But s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ing is@@ n't al@@ ways s@@ uch a b@@ ad thing@@ .
F@@ in@@ ally -- O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed, and you as@@ k wh@@ y, wh@@ o@@ 's respon@@ si@@ bl@@ e, the ans@@ w@@ er is c@@ lear@@ : the world is respon@@ si@@ bl@@ e.
What could you do@@ ?
When there are h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ing, and you as@@ k wh@@ y, wh@@ o@@ 's respon@@ si@@ b@@ le@@ ?
It is e@@ qu@@ ally cl@@ ear that the ans@@ w@@ er to the quest@@ ion is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have d@@ one bet@@ ter@@ .
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d different k@@ in@@ ds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ pla@@ y, there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fa@@ il@@ u@@ re.
And so when people make dec@@ is@@ ion@@ s, and even th@@ ough the res@@ ul@@ ts of the dec@@ is@@ ion@@ s are go@@ o@@ d, they fe@@ el dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about the@@ m@@ ; they bl@@ ame the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has expl@@ o@@ ded in the indu@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.
I belie@@ ve a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this expl@@ os@@ ion of de@@ pres@@ si@@ on, and also su@@ ici@@ de, is that people have experien@@ ces that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds are so hi@@ gh@@ ,
and then when they have to expl@@ a@@ in these experien@@ ces to the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es, they think they're at fa@@ ul@@ t.
And so the ne@@ t res@@ ul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al, ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y, and we fe@@ el wor@@ s@@ e.
So le@@ t me re@@ min@@ d you.
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tr@@ u@@ e, and it's all f@@ al@@ s@@ e. It is not tr@@ u@@ e.
Th@@ ere's no quest@@ ion that some ch@@ o@@ ice is better than n@@ on@@ e, but it doesn't fol@@ low from that that more ch@@ o@@ ice is better than some ch@@ o@@ ice.
Th@@ ere's some mag@@ ical am@@ oun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pret@@ ty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have l@@ ong sin@@ ce pas@@ s@@ ed the poin@@ t where op@@ tions im@@ pro@@ ve our w@@ el@@ f@@ are.
Now, as a pol@@ ic@@ y mat@@ ter -- I'm al@@ most d@@ one -- as a pol@@ ic@@ y mat@@ ter@@ , the thing to think about is th@@ is@@ :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this ch@@ o@@ ice in indu@@ stri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es is materi@@ al a@@ ff@@ lu@@ en@@ ce.
There are lo@@ ts of plac@@ es in the worl@@ d, and we have hear@@ d about se@@ ver@@ al of the@@ m, where their prob@@ le@@ m is not that they have to@@ o much ch@@ o@@ ice.
Th@@ e@@ ir prob@@ le@@ m is that they have to@@ o lit@@ t@@ l@@ e.
So the stu@@ f@@ f I'm tal@@ king about is the p@@ ec@@ ul@@ iar prob@@ le@@ m of mo@@ der@@ n@@ , a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent, W@@ est@@ er@@ n soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es.
And what is so fr@@ u@@ str@@ ating and inf@@ ur@@ i@@ ating is th@@ is@@ : S@@ te@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ est@@ er@@ day about how these ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve and diff@@ icul@@ t@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all chil@@ d se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p@@ .
What I'm tel@@ l@@ ing you is that these ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve, compl@@ ic@@ ated ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es -- it's not simpl@@ y that they don't hel@@ p@@ .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off@@ .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es to make all of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es in which people have to@@ o few op@@ tion@@ s, not only would those peopl@@ e's li@@ ves be im@@ pro@@ ve@@ d, but our@@ s would be im@@ pro@@ ved al@@ so@@ ,
which is what econom@@ ist@@ s c@@ all a "@@ P@@ are@@ to@@ -@@ im@@ pro@@ ving mo@@ ve@@ ."
In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make every@@ one better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess ch@@ o@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us.
So to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de. [@@ You can be any@@ thing you want to be -- no l@@ imit@@ s@@ ] Y@@ ou@@ 're sup@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ ad this car@@ to@@ on, an@@ d, being a so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated person@@ , say, "@@ A@@ h@@ ! What does this f@@ is@@ h kno@@ w@@ ?
You know, no@@ thing is possi@@ ble in this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ." I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ed imagin@@ ation, a m@@ y@@ o@@ pi@@ c vie@@ w of the world -- and that's the way I re@@ ad it at fir@@ st@@ .
The more I thought about it, ho@@ we@@ ver@@ , the more I came to the vie@@ w that this f@@ is@@ h kno@@ ws some@@ thing@@ .
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the mat@@ ter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you don't have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ . You have par@@ al@@ ys@@ is.
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ bl@@ e, you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ ys@@ is, and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion.
E@@ very@@ body ne@@ e@@ ds a f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly to@@ o l@@ imit@@ ed -- per@@ hap@@ s even for the f@@ is@@ h, cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us.
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ y, an@@ d, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, dis@@ ast@@ er.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
