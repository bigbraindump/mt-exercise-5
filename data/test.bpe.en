S@@ e@@ ver@@ al years ag@@ o here at TE@@ D@@ , P@@ e@@ ter S@@ k@@ ill@@ man intr@@ o@@ du@@ ce@@ d a desig@@ n ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge called the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a@@ 's pret@@ ty simpl@@ e:
T@@ ea@@ m@@ s of f@@ our have to buil@@ d the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ ture out of 20 st@@ ic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , one y@@ ar@@ d of t@@ ap@@ e, one y@@ ar@@ d of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low@@ .
The mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low has to be on to@@ p@@ .
An@@ d, th@@ ough it se@@ em@@ s really simpl@@ e, it's actually pret@@ ty har@@ d because it for@@ ces people to col@@ l@@ abor@@ ate very qu@@ ick@@ l@@ y.
And so@@ , I thought this was an interest@@ ing ide@@ a, and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a desig@@ n wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p@@ .
And it was a hu@@ ge suc@@ ces@@ s.
And sin@@ ce th@@ en, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 desig@@ n wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p@@ s ac@@ ros@@ s the world with stu@@ dent@@ s and desig@@ n@@ ers and ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect@@ s, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ t@@ une 5@@ 0@@ , and there's something about this ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ es@@ son@@ s about the natur@@ e of col@@ l@@ abor@@ ation, and I'@@ d like to sh@@ are some of them with you.
So, nor@@ m@@ ally, most people be@@ g@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves to the t@@ as@@ k.
They talk about it, they fi@@ g@@ ure out what it's going to look lik@@ e, they jo@@ c@@ k@@ ey for pow@@ er. Th@@ en they sp@@ end some time plan@@ n@@ ing, organiz@@ ing,
they sk@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ . They sp@@ end the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the st@@ ic@@ ks into e@@ ver@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s. And then fin@@ ally, just as they're r@@ un@@ ning out of tim@@ e, some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ w, and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on to@@ p@@ , and then they st@@ and bac@@ k, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their wor@@ k.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the tim@@ e, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " tur@@ n@@ s into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the we@@ i@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ca@@ us@@ es the enti@@ re struc@@ ture to buc@@ k@@ le and to col@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ e.
So there are a num@@ ber of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " mom@@ ents than oth@@ er@@ s, and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gr@@ ad@@ u@@ at@@ es of bus@@ in@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
They li@@ e, they ch@@ e@@ at, they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produc@@ e really l@@ ame struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
And of cour@@ se there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s, and am@@ ong the b@@ est are rec@@ ent gr@@ ad@@ u@@ at@@ es of k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ .
And it's pret@@ ty a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing.
A@@ s P@@ e@@ ter tel@@ l@@ s us, not only do they produc@@ e the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s, but they're the most interest@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ res of them all@@ .
So the quest@@ ion you want to as@@ k is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y@@ ? What is it about the@@ m@@ ?
And P@@ e@@ ter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the ki@@ ds sp@@ end any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ p@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti@@ , In@@ c@@ . R@@ i@@ ght@@ ?
They don't sp@@ end time jo@@ c@@ ke@@ ying for pow@@ er.
But there's another reas@@ on as w@@ ell@@ .
And the reas@@ on is that bus@@ in@@ ess stu@@ dent@@ s are tr@@ ain@@ ed to find the sing@@ le right plan@@ , ri@@ ght@@ ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te on it.
And then what happen@@ s is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on the to@@ p@@ , they r@@ un out of time and what happen@@ s@@ ?
It's a cr@@ is@@ is.
S@@ o@@ und famil@@ iar@@ ? R@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
What k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differen@@ t@@ ly is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ w, and they buil@@ d pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ es, suc@@ ces@@ si@@ ve pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ es, al@@ ways ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on to@@ p@@ , so they have mul@@ ti@@ ple tim@@ es to fi@@ x when they buil@@ d pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ es al@@ ong the wa@@ y.
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n@@ ers re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ e this t@@ y@@ pe of col@@ l@@ abor@@ ation as the es@@ sen@@ ce of the it@@ er@@ ative proces@@ s.
And with each ver@@ si@@ on, ki@@ ds get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn't wor@@ k.
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to pla@@ y in pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe is really es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al, but let@@ 's look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form@@ .
So the a@@ ver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; bus@@ in@@ ess sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s stu@@ dent@@ s, about hal@@ f of that@@ ; la@@ w@@ y@@ er@@ s, a little bet@@ ter@@ , but not much better than that, k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ er@@ s, better than most ad@@ ul@@ t@@ s.
Wh@@ o does the very b@@ est@@ ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ect@@ s and en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ s, th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ l@@ y. Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ ture I've se@@ en@@ .
And why is it@@ ? Because they underst@@ and tri@@ ang@@ les and self@@ -@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ om@@ e@@ tr@@ ical pat@@ tern@@ s are the k@@ ey to buil@@ ding st@@ able struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e,
but here@@ 's where it get@@ s interest@@ ing.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am@@ , they get sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant@@ ly bet@@ ter@@ .
It's incredi@@ bl@@ e. You know, you look aro@@ un@@ d, you go@@ , "@@ O@@ h, that te@@ am@@ 's going to w@@ in@@ ."
You can just tell be@@ fo@@ re@@ han@@ d. And why is that@@ ?
Because they have speci@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation.
They man@@ age the proces@@ s, they underst@@ and the proces@@ s.
And any te@@ am who man@@ ag@@ es and pa@@ ys cl@@ ose at@@ ten@@ tion to work will sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's per@@ for@@ man@@ ce.
S@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ aliz@@ ed sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the com@@ bin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to str@@ ong suc@@ ces@@ s.
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form@@ , you@@ 'll get ma@@ ybe si@@ x or so that have st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re@@ s.
And I tri@@ ed something interest@@ ing.
I thou@@ ght, let@@ 's up the an@@ te, on@@ ce.
So I off@@ ere@@ d a 1@@ 0@@ ,000 dol@@ l@@ ar pr@@ iz@@ e of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to the w@@ in@@ ning te@@ am@@ .
So what do you think happen@@ ed to these desig@@ n stu@@ dent@@ s@@ ?
What was the res@@ ul@@ t@@ ?
H@@ ere's what happen@@ ed@@ :
No@@ t one te@@ am had a st@@ and@@ ing struc@@ tu@@ re.
If any@@ one had buil@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch struc@@ tu@@ re, they would have ta@@ k@@ en h@@ ome the pr@@ iz@@ e.
So, is@@ n't that interest@@ ing@@ ? That hi@@ gh sta@@ kes have a str@@ ong im@@ pac@@ t.
We did the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise ag@@ a@@ in with the same stu@@ dent@@ s.
What do you think happen@@ ed th@@ en@@ ?
So now they underst@@ and the val@@ ue of pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ ing.
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very b@@ est@@ .
They pro@@ du@@ ce@@ d the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tu@@ res in the lea@@ st am@@ oun@@ t of tim@@ e.
So there's de@@ ep l@@ es@@ son@@ s for us about the natur@@ e of in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves and suc@@ ces@@ s.
So, you might as@@ k@@ : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually sp@@ end time wr@@ it@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ ?
And the reas@@ on is, I hel@@ p cre@@ ate di@@ g@@ it@@ al to@@ ol@@ s and proces@@ s@@ es to hel@@ p te@@ am@@ s buil@@ d car@@ s and vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect@@ s.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ p@@ s them i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ de@@ n as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion@@ s.
Bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, fr@@ an@@ k@@ ly, every pro@@ j@@ ect has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ w, doesn't it@@ ?
The ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge pro@@ vide@@ s a s@@ ha@@ red experien@@ ce, a com@@ m@@ on l@@ ang@@ u@@ ag@@ e, a com@@ m@@ on st@@ ance to buil@@ d the right pro@@ tot@@ y@@ p@@ e.
And so@@ , this is the val@@ ue of the experien@@ ce, of this so sim@@ ple ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e.
And those of you who are interest@@ ed may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ . It's a b@@ lo@@ g that you can look at how to buil@@ d the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low@@ s.
Th@@ ere's st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ st@@ ep in@@ struc@@ tions on this.
There are c@@ ra@@ z@@ y exam@@ pl@@ es from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system@@ .
Th@@ ere's world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as w@@ ell@@ .
And the fund@@ ament@@ al l@@ es@@ son@@ , I bel@@ i@@ ev@@ e, is that desig@@ n tr@@ ul@@ y is a con@@ t@@ act sp@@ or@@ t.
It de@@ man@@ ds that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ s@@ es to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we ap@@ pl@@ y the very b@@ est of our thin@@ k@@ ing, our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge that we have at han@@ d.
And som@@ et@@ im@@ es, a little pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe of this experien@@ ce is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " mom@@ ent to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " mom@@ ent.
And that can make a big differen@@ ce.
Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's pre@@ ten@@ d right here we have a m@@ ach@@ in@@ e. A big m@@ ach@@ in@@ e, a co@@ ol@@ , TE@@ D@@ -@@ is@@ h m@@ ach@@ in@@ e, and it's a time m@@ ach@@ in@@ e.
And every@@ one in this ro@@ om has to get into it.
And you can go bac@@ k@@ war@@ ds, you can go for@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ ; you can@@ not sta@@ y where you are.
And I won@@ der what you@@ '@@ d ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, because I've been as@@ king my fri@@ en@@ ds this quest@@ ion a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go bac@@ k.
I don't kno@@ w. They want to go back be@@ fore there were a@@ ut@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ Americ@@ an I@@ dol@@ ."
I don't kno@@ w.
I'm con@@ vin@@ ce@@ d that there's some sort of pul@@ l And I underst@@ and that.
I'm not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go bac@@ k, and it's not because I'm ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ ou@@ s. It's because possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es on this plan@@ et, they don't go bac@@ k, they go for@@ war@@ d.
So I want to get in the m@@ ach@@ in@@ e, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there's ever been on this plan@@ et by any m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e that you w@@ is@@ h to ch@@ o@@ os@@ e: heal@@ th@@ , we@@ al@@ th@@ , mo@@ bil@@ ity, op@@ port@@ un@@ ity, de@@ cl@@ in@@ ing r@@ at@@ es of di@@ sea@@ se ...
Th@@ ere's never been a time like this.
M@@ y gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ p@@ aren@@ ts di@@ ed, all of the@@ m, by the time they were 6@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y gr@@ and@@ p@@ aren@@ ts p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that num@@ ber to 7@@ 0@@ .
M@@ y p@@ aren@@ ts are cl@@ os@@ ing in on 8@@ 0@@ .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the be@@ gin@@ ning of my de@@ at@@ h num@@ b@@ er.
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bi@@ gg@@ er de@@ al than that.
A ki@@ d bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i to@@ day can ex@@ p@@ ect to li@@ ve as l@@ ong as the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est man in the world did 1@@ 00 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ in@@ k about that, it's an incredi@@ ble fac@@ t.
And why is it tr@@ u@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x k@@ ill@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people on this plan@@ et.
It res@@ hap@@ ed the de@@ mo@@ grap@@ h@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no w@@ ar ever ha@@ s.
It's g@@ on@@ e. It's v@@ an@@ is@@ he@@ d.
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ is@@ h@@ ed it. Pu@@ ff@@ .
In the r@@ ich worl@@ d, di@@ sea@@ s@@ es that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed mil@@ li@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ag@@ o no l@@ ong@@ er exist@@ , har@@ d@@ l@@ y.
D@@ i@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a, r@@ ub@@ ell@@ a, pol@@ i@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are@@ ?
V@@ ac@@ cin@@ es, mo@@ der@@ n medic@@ in@@ e, our abil@@ ity to fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of peopl@@ e, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ o@@ d.
And to my min@@ d, the scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od -- trying stu@@ f@@ f ou@@ t, se@@ e@@ ing if it wor@@ k@@ s, chang@@ ing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ compl@@ is@@ h@@ ment@@ s of h@@ uman@@ ity.
So that's the good ne@@ w@@ s.
Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, that's all the good ne@@ ws because there are some other problem@@ s, and they@@ 've been men@@ tion@@ ed many tim@@ es. And one of them is that de@@ sp@@ ite all our ac@@ compl@@ is@@ h@@ ment@@ s, a bil@@ lion people go to b@@ ed h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every da@@ y.
That num@@ ber@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ris@@ ing really rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul.
And not only that, we've used our imagin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tr@@ as@@ h this glob@@ e.
Po@@ t@@ able wat@@ er, ar@@ able l@@ an@@ d, ra@@ in@@ fo@@ rest@@ s, o@@ il@@ , g@@ as@@ : they're going a@@ wa@@ y, and they're going a@@ way so@@ on,
and un@@ less we in@@ no@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ es@@ s, we're going a@@ way to@@ o.
So the quest@@ ion is@@ : C@@ an we do that@@ ? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's cl@@ ear that we can make fo@@ od that will fe@@ ed bil@@ li@@ ons of people with@@ out rap@@ ing the l@@ and that they li@@ ve on.
I think we can pow@@ er this world with energ@@ y that doesn't also dest@@ ro@@ y it.
I really do belie@@ ve that, an@@ d, no@@ , it ain@@ 't w@@ is@@ h@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
But here@@ 's the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght@@ :
We@@ 've never ne@@ e@@ ded pro@@ g@@ res@@ s in scien@@ ce more than we need it right no@@ w. Ne@@ ver@@ . And we've also never been in a pos@@ iti@@ on to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can to@@ da@@ y.
We@@ 're on the ver@@ ge of a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing, a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing ev@@ ents in many fi@@ el@@ ds,
and y@@ et I actually think we@@ '@@ d have to go back h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds, 3@@ 00 year@@ s, be@@ fore the E@@ n@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment@@ , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ l@@ ed pro@@ g@@ res@@ s, when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more fr@@ on@@ t@@ s, than we do no@@ w.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple w@@ ra@@ p the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves in their bel@@ i@@ ef@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ ght@@ ly that you can't se@@ t them fre@@ e.
No@@ t even the tr@@ ut@@ h will se@@ t them fre@@ e.
An@@ d, li@@ st@@ en, every@@ on@@ e's ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ ion@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ in@@ ion about pro@@ g@@ res@@ s. But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're not ent@@ it@@ l@@ ed to your own fac@@ t@@ s. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.
And this to@@ ok me a@@ wh@@ ile to fi@@ g@@ ure ou@@ t.
A@@ b@@ out a dec@@ a@@ de ag@@ o, I w@@ ro@@ te a st@@ ory about v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es for The New Y@@ or@@ k@@ er. A little st@@ or@@ y.
And I was a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed to find op@@ pos@@ iti@@ on@@ : op@@ pos@@ iti@@ on to what is, after all@@ , the most eff@@ ec@@ tive publi@@ c heal@@ th m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e in human h@@ ist@@ or@@ y.
I didn't know what to do@@ , so I just did what I do@@ : I w@@ ro@@ te a st@@ ory and I mo@@ ved on.
And so@@ on after that, I w@@ ro@@ te a st@@ ory about gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ ere@@ d fo@@ o@@ d.
S@@ ame thing@@ , only bi@@ gg@@ er.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were going c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
So I w@@ ro@@ te a st@@ ory about that to@@ o, and I c@@ oul@@ dn't underst@@ and why people thought this was "@@ F@@ ran@@ k@@ en@@ fo@@ od@@ s@@ ," why they thought mo@@ ving m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es around in a speci@@ fic@@ , ra@@ ther than a hap@@ ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d wa@@ y, was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ s@@ ing on n@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ 's gro@@ un@@ d.
B@@ ut@@ , you know, I do what I do@@ . I w@@ ro@@ te the st@@ or@@ y, I mo@@ ved on.
I me@@ an, I'm a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist@@ . We t@@ y@@ p@@ e, we fil@@ e, we go to din@@ n@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these st@@ ori@@ es bo@@ the@@ red me, and I c@@ oul@@ dn't fi@@ g@@ ure out wh@@ y, and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I di@@ d.
And that's because those f@@ an@@ at@@ ic@@ s that were d@@ ri@@ ving me c@@ ra@@ z@@ y w@@ ere@@ n't actually f@@ an@@ at@@ ic@@ s at all@@ .
They were thou@@ ght@@ ful peopl@@ e, educ@@ ated peopl@@ e, dec@@ ent peopl@@ e.
They were ex@@ act@@ ly like the people in this ro@@ om@@ .
And it just dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ed me so mu@@ ch@@ .
But then I thou@@ ght, you know, let@@ 's be h@@ on@@ est@@ .
We@@ 're at a poin@@ t in this world where we don't have the same rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to pro@@ g@@ res@@ s that we used to@@ .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ent@@ l@@ y.
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic ter@@ m@@ s with little qu@@ o@@ te@@ s around it@@ : "@@ pro@@ g@@ res@@ s@@ ."
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, there are reas@@ ons for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are.
We@@ 've l@@ ost fa@@ it@@ h in inst@@ itu@@ tion@@ s, in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity, and som@@ et@@ im@@ es in scien@@ ce it@@ self@@ ,
and there's no reas@@ on we sh@@ oul@@ dn't ha@@ ve.
You can just say a few n@@ am@@ es and people will underst@@ an@@ d.
Ch@@ er@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l@@ , B@@ ho@@ p@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, V@@ io@@ x@@ x@@ , w@@ ea@@ p@@ ons of ma@@ s@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion@@ , h@@ ang@@ ing c@@ ha@@ d@@ s.
You know, you can ch@@ o@@ ose your li@@ st@@ .
There are quest@@ ion@@ s and problem@@ s with the people we used to belie@@ ve were al@@ ways ri@@ ght,
so be s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k quest@@ ion@@ s, de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of@@ , de@@ m@@ and e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce.
D@@ on@@ 't take any@@ thing for gr@@ an@@ te@@ d.
But here@@ 's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of@@ , you need to ac@@ cep@@ t the pro@@ of@@ , and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we're now in an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of f@@ ear like one I've never se@@ en and ho@@ pe never to see again@@ .
A@@ b@@ out 1@@ 2 years ag@@ o, there was a st@@ ory publi@@ sh@@ ed, a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble st@@ or@@ y, that lin@@ ked the e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m to the m@@ eas@@ l@@ es, m@@ um@@ p@@ s and r@@ ub@@ el@@ la v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine sho@@ t.
V@@ er@@ y sc@@ ar@@ y.
T@@ ons of studi@@ es were d@@ one to see if this was tr@@ u@@ e.
T@@ ons of studi@@ es should have been don@@ e@@ ; it's a ser@@ i@@ ous is@@ su@@ e.
The data came bac@@ k.
The data came back from the Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es, from E@@ n@@ gl@@ an@@ d, from S@@ we@@ den@@ , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a, and it was all the s@@ am@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no con@@ nec@@ tion@@ , n@@ one at all@@ .
It doesn't mat@@ ter@@ . It doesn't mat@@ ter because we belie@@ ve an@@ ec@@ do@@ te@@ s, we belie@@ ve what we se@@ e, what we think we se@@ e, what ma@@ kes us fe@@ el re@@ al.
We don't belie@@ ve a b@@ unc@@ h of do@@ cum@@ ents from a go@@ vern@@ ment off@@ ici@@ al gi@@ ving us dat@@ a, and I do underst@@ and that, I think we all do@@ .
But you know wh@@ at@@ ?
The res@@ ul@@ t of that has been dis@@ astr@@ ou@@ s. D@@ is@@ astr@@ ous because here@@ 's a fac@@ t@@ : The Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es is one of the only coun@@ tri@@ es in the world where the v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine r@@ ate for m@@ eas@@ les is going do@@ wn@@ .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul, and we should be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
It's h@@ or@@ ri@@ bl@@ e.
What kind of a thing happen@@ ed that we could do that@@ ?
Now, I underst@@ and it. I do underst@@ and it.
Bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, did any@@ one have m@@ eas@@ les here@@ ?
H@@ as one per@@ son in this au@@ di@@ en@@ ce ever se@@ en some@@ one di@@ e of m@@ eas@@ l@@ es@@ ?
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happ@@ en very mu@@ ch@@ .
D@@ o@@ es@@ n't happ@@ en in this coun@@ try at all@@ , but it happen@@ ed 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 tim@@ es in the world last year@@ .
That's a lot of de@@ at@@ h of m@@ eas@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our@@ .
But sin@@ ce it didn't happ@@ en here@@ , we can put it out of our min@@ ds, and people like J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing m@@ ess@@ ag@@ es of f@@ ear and il@@ lit@@ er@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ form@@ s like "@@ O@@ pra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ r@@ y K@@ ing L@@ i@@ ve@@ ."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k ca@@ us@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't underst@@ and that these things se@@ em the s@@ am@@ e, but they're al@@ most never the s@@ am@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n@@ , and we need to lear@@ n it really so@@ on.
This gu@@ y was a h@@ er@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He to@@ ok one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind a@@ way from us.
N@@ o fe@@ ar, no ag@@ on@@ y. P@@ ol@@ i@@ o -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ on@@ e.
That gu@@ y in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ l@@ e, not so mu@@ ch@@ .
H@@ is n@@ ame is P@@ a@@ ul O@@ ff@@ it.
He just devel@@ op@@ ed a ro@@ ta@@ vir@@ us v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine with a b@@ unc@@ h of other peopl@@ e.
It@@ 'll sa@@ ve the li@@ ves of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 ki@@ ds in the devel@@ op@@ ing world every year@@ .
P@@ re@@ t@@ ty go@@ o@@ d, ri@@ ght@@ ?
Well, it's go@@ o@@ d, ex@@ cep@@ t that P@@ a@@ ul go@@ es around tal@@ king about v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es and sa@@ ys how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just st@@ o@@ p the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually sa@@ ys it that wa@@ y.
So, P@@ a@@ ul@@ 's a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist@@ .
When P@@ a@@ ul sp@@ ea@@ ks in a publi@@ c hear@@ ing, he can't te@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ d@@ s.
He get@@ s called at h@@ ome because people like to tell hi@@ m that they re@@ mem@@ ber where his ki@@ ds go to sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And wh@@ y@@ ? Because P@@ a@@ ul made a v@@ ac@@ cin@@ e.
I don't need to say this, but v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al.
You take them a@@ wa@@ y, di@@ sea@@ se com@@ es bac@@ k, h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble di@@ sea@@ s@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have m@@ eas@@ les in this coun@@ try no@@ w.
And it's get@@ ting wor@@ se, and pret@@ ty so@@ on ki@@ ds are going to di@@ e of it ag@@ a@@ in because it's just a num@@ b@@ ers g@@ am@@ e.
And they're not just going to di@@ e of m@@ eas@@ l@@ es.
What about pol@@ io@@ ? L@@ et@@ 's have that. Wh@@ y no@@ t@@ ?
A col@@ le@@ ge clas@@ sm@@ ate of mine w@@ ro@@ te me a c@@ ou@@ ple we@@ e@@ ks ag@@ o and sai@@ d she thought I was a little stri@@ dent@@ .
N@@ o on@@ e's ever sai@@ d that be@@ fo@@ re.
S@@ he was@@ n't going to v@@ ac@@ cin@@ ate her ki@@ d again@@ st pol@@ i@@ o,
no wa@@ y.
F@@ in@@ e.
Wh@@ y@@ ? Because we don't have pol@@ io@@ . And you know wh@@ at@@ ?
We didn't have pol@@ i@@ o in this coun@@ try y@@ est@@ er@@ da@@ y.
To@@ day, I don't know, ma@@ ybe a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ o@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing, and he@@ 's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now he@@ 's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And he@@ 's going to l@@ and in a c@@ ou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s, he@@ 's going to ren@@ t a car@@ , and he@@ 's going to come to L@@ ong B@@ e@@ ach@@ , and he@@ 's going to at@@ ten@@ d one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED din@@ n@@ ers t@@ on@@ i@@ gh@@ t.
And he doesn't know that he@@ 's inf@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic di@@ sea@@ se, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world wor@@ k@@ s.
That's the plan@@ et we li@@ ve on. D@@ on@@ 't pre@@ ten@@ d it is@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now, we lo@@ ve to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ sel@@ ves in li@@ es. We lo@@ ve to do it.
E@@ very@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ in@@ s this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea, a little an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because hal@@ f of Americ@@ ans do every da@@ y.
They take the stu@@ ff@@ , and they take al@@ tern@@ ative medic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't mat@@ ter how of@@ ten we find out that they're us@@ el@@ es@@ s.
The data sa@@ ys it all the tim@@ e.
They d@@ ar@@ k@@ en your ur@@ in@@ e. They al@@ most never do more than that.
It's o@@ k@@ a@@ y, you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 bil@@ lion dol@@ lar@@ s for d@@ ar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e?
I'm tot@@ ally with you.
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e. D@@ ar@@ k.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ? Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, I think I underst@@ an@@ d, we h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g P@@ har@@ ma@@ .
We h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g G@@ o@@ vern@@ ment@@ . We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an.
And we sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t@@ : O@@ ur heal@@ th care syst@@ em suc@@ k@@ s.
It's cr@@ u@@ el to mil@@ li@@ ons of peopl@@ e.
It's ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly col@@ d and s@@ oul@@ -@@ b@@ en@@ ding to those of us who can even af@@ for@@ d it.
So we r@@ un a@@ way from it, and where do we r@@ un@@ ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ m@@ s of B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .
That's f@@ ant@@ ast@@ ic. I lo@@ ve B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .
B@@ ut@@ , you know, it's really a ser@@ i@@ ous thing because this stu@@ f@@ f is cr@@ ap@@ , and we sp@@ end bil@@ li@@ ons of dol@@ lar@@ s on it.
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ p@@ s here@@ .
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go@@ , f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; ec@@ h@@ in@@ ac@@ ea, f@@ ra@@ u@@ d@@ ; ac@@ ai -- I don't even know what that is but we're sp@@ en@@ ding bil@@ li@@ ons of dol@@ lar@@ s on it -- it's f@@ ra@@ u@@ d.
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? When I say this stu@@ ff@@ , people sc@@ re@@ am at me, and they say, "@@ What do you care@@ ? L@@ et people do what they want to do@@ . It ma@@ kes them fe@@ el go@@ od@@ ."
And you know wh@@ at@@ ? Y@@ ou@@ 're wr@@ ong@@ .
Because I don't care if it's the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S wh@@ o@@ 's sa@@ y@@ ing, "@@ H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of my exper@@ ts on ma@@ m@@ mo@@ gr@@ am@@ s@@ ," or some can@@ ce@@ r qu@@ ac@@ k who w@@ ant@@ s to tre@@ at his p@@ ati@@ ent with co@@ f@@ fe@@ e en@@ e@@ ma@@ s.
When you start down the ro@@ ad where belie@@ f and ma@@ gi@@ c re@@ place e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce and scien@@ ce, you end up in a place you don't want to b@@ e.
You end up in T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Afr@@ ic@@ a.
He k@@ ill@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ e@@ tr@@ oo@@ t, g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ tive than the an@@ ti@@ re@@ tr@@ o@@ vir@@ al dr@@ ug@@ s we know can s@@ low the cour@@ se of A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of ne@@ ed@@ less de@@ a@@ th@@ s in a coun@@ try that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this di@@ sea@@ s@@ e.
P@@ lea@@ se, don't tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces to these thing@@ s.
There are. There al@@ ways are.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ less e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c we're in the mi@@ d@@ d@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ ere@@ d fo@@ od and the organ@@ ic el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ b@@ ate. It has to st@@ op@@ .
It's a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ ds, about m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ s.
It's ide@@ olog@@ y, it's not scien@@ ce.
E@@ very sing@@ le thing we e@@ at, every gra@@ in of r@@ ice, every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y, every B@@ r@@ us@@ sel@@ s s@@ pr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man@@ .
You know, there w@@ ere@@ n't t@@ ang@@ er@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ de@@ n of E@@ den@@ .
There was@@ n't any c@@ ant@@ al@@ ou@@ p@@ e.
There w@@ ere@@ n't Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s tre@@ es. We made it all@@ .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 year@@ s.
And some of it wor@@ ke@@ d, and some of it di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
We got ri@@ d of the stu@@ f@@ f that di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ ise way --
and there are ris@@ k@@ s, ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into r@@ ice, and that stu@@ f@@ f can hel@@ p mil@@ li@@ ons of peopl@@ e, mil@@ li@@ ons of peopl@@ e, pr@@ ol@@ ong their li@@ v@@ es.
You don't want to do that@@ ?
I have to say, I don't underst@@ and it.
We ob@@ j@@ ect to gen@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ ere@@ d fo@@ o@@ d.
Wh@@ y do we do that@@ ?
Well, the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly h@@ ear are@@ : To@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s, p@@ est@@ ici@@ de@@ s, h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tu@@ re, we don't want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing@@ , that's wr@@ ong@@ .
We don't comp@@ ani@@ es pat@@ ent@@ ing lif@@ e.
We don't want comp@@ ani@@ es o@@ w@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is@@ ?
Y@@ es, you're ri@@ gh@@ t. L@@ et@@ 's fi@@ x it.
It's tr@@ u@@ e, we've got a hu@@ ge fo@@ od problem@@ , but this is@@ n't scien@@ ce.
This has no@@ thing to do with scien@@ ce.
It's la@@ w, it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's pat@@ ent stu@@ ff@@ .
You know scien@@ ce is@@ n't a comp@@ an@@ y.
It's not a coun@@ tr@@ y.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a proces@@ s.
It's a proces@@ s, and som@@ et@@ im@@ es it wor@@ ks and som@@ et@@ im@@ es it does@@ n@@ '@@ t, but the idea that we should not al@@ low scien@@ ce to do its jo@@ b because we're af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing, and it's pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing mil@@ li@@ ons of people from pr@@ os@@ per@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more fo@@ od than we do right no@@ w,
7@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
This in@@ vest@@ ment in Afr@@ ica over the last 3@@ 0 year@@ s.
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul. D@@ is@@ gr@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul.
They need it, and we're not gi@@ ving it to them.
And wh@@ y@@ ? G@@ en@@ et@@ ically en@@ gin@@ e@@ ere@@ d fo@@ o@@ d.
We don't want to en@@ cour@@ age people to e@@ at that ro@@ t@@ ten stu@@ ff@@ , like cas@@ sa@@ va for inst@@ an@@ ce.
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a@@ 's something that hal@@ f a bil@@ lion people e@@ at.
It's kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o.
It's just a b@@ unc@@ h of cal@@ ori@@ es. It suc@@ k@@ s.
It doesn't have nu@@ tri@@ ent@@ s, it doesn't have prote@@ in, and scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s are en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right no@@ w.
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ '@@ d be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.
They w@@ oul@@ dn't star@@ ve, and you know wh@@ at@@ ?
That would be n@@ ice. It w@@ oul@@ dn't be Ch@@ ez P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ice.
And all I can say about this is@@ : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it@@ ?
I me@@ an, let@@ 's as@@ k our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it@@ ?
Because we don't want to mo@@ ve gen@@ es aro@@ und@@ ?
This is about mo@@ ving gen@@ es aro@@ un@@ d. It's not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ s.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ sist@@ en@@ ce on ha@@ ving bi@@ gg@@ er fo@@ o@@ d, better fo@@ o@@ d, sing@@ ul@@ ar fo@@ o@@ d.
This is@@ n't about R@@ ice K@@ ri@@ sp@@ i@@ es, this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to underst@@ and what that me@@ an@@ t.
Bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, you know some@@ thing@@ ?
If we don@@ '@@ t, if we continu@@ e to act the way we're act@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : hi@@ gh@@ -@@ te@@ ch col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ is@@ m.
Th@@ ere's no other way to de@@ scri@@ be wh@@ at's going on here@@ .
It's self@@ is@@ h, it's ug@@ ly, it's b@@ en@@ e@@ at@@ h us, and we really have to st@@ o@@ p it.
So after this a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly f@@ un con@@ vers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time m@@ ach@@ ine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"
A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y. A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y, I do@@ .
It's st@@ uc@@ k in the pres@@ ent right no@@ w, but we have an a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing op@@ port@@ un@@ ity.
We can se@@ t that time m@@ ach@@ ine on any@@ thing we wan@@ t.
We can mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it, and we're going to mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it.
We have to have these con@@ vers@@ ations and we have to thin@@ k, but when we get in the time m@@ ach@@ ine and we go a@@ hea@@ d, we're going to be happ@@ y we do@@ .
I know that we can@@ , and as f@@ ar as I'm con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world ne@@ e@@ ds right no@@ w.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
O@@ ne day, L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z was w@@ al@@ king al@@ ong the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es when he hear@@ d b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful mus@@ ic.
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man@@ , an Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ Americ@@ an man@@ , ch@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, r@@ ug@@ ge@@ d, h@@ om@@ el@@ es@@ s, pla@@ ying a vi@@ ol@@ in that only had two str@@ ing@@ s.
And I'm tel@@ l@@ ing a st@@ ory that many of you know, because S@@ te@@ ve@@ 's col@@ um@@ n@@ s bec@@ ame the bas@@ is for a bo@@ o@@ k, which was tur@@ ned into a mo@@ vi@@ e, with R@@ ob@@ er@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as S@@ te@@ ve L@@ o@@ pe@@ z@@ , and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ o@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ er@@ s, the J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tr@@ ain@@ ed dou@@ ble bas@@ s@@ ist wh@@ ose pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing care@@ er was cut sh@@ or@@ t by a tr@@ ag@@ ic a@@ ff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ a.
N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el dro@@ p@@ p@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d, he su@@ ff@@ ere@@ d a compl@@ e@@ te bre@@ a@@ k@@ do@@ wn@@ , and 3@@ 0 years lat@@ er he was li@@ ving h@@ om@@ el@@ ess on the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ o@@ w in do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es.
I en@@ cour@@ age all of you to re@@ ad S@@ te@@ ve@@ 's bo@@ ok or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ v@@ ie to underst@@ and not only the b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful b@@ ond that form@@ ed between these two men@@ , but how mus@@ ic hel@@ p@@ ed s@@ ha@@ pe that b@@ on@@ d, and ultim@@ at@@ ely was in@@ str@@ um@@ ent@@ al -- if you@@ 'll par@@ d@@ on the p@@ un -- in hel@@ p@@ ing N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the st@@ re@@ et@@ s.
I me@@ t M@@ r@@ . A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8@@ , two years ag@@ o, at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all@@ .
He had just hear@@ d a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven@@ 's F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ i@@ es, and came bac@@ k@@ st@@ age and intr@@ o@@ du@@ ce@@ d h@@ im@@ self@@ .
He was sp@@ ea@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ t@@ on and how the D@@ od@@ g@@ ers were never going to make the W@@ or@@ ld S@@ eri@@ es, all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ ol@@ in pas@@ s@@ age work in the last mo@@ ve@@ ment of B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven@@ 's F@@ our@@ th S@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y.
And we got tal@@ king about mus@@ ic, and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from S@@ te@@ ve a few da@@ ys lat@@ er sa@@ ying that N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interest@@ ed in a vi@@ ol@@ in l@@ ess@@ on with m@@ e.
Now, I should men@@ tion that N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el re@@ f@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ c@@ k th@@ er@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and h@@ and@@ cu@@ ff@@ s, and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ y@@ ed with hi@@ m for his enti@@ re lif@@ e.
But as a res@@ ul@@ t no@@ w, he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ c ep@@ is@@ o@@ de@@ s,
the wor@@ st of which can man@@ i@@ f@@ est the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves as hi@@ m expl@@ o@@ ding and then dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing for da@@ y@@ s, wan@@ der@@ ing the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ o@@ w, ex@@ pos@@ ed to its h@@ or@@ r@@ or@@ s, with the tor@@ ment of his own min@@ d un@@ lea@@ sh@@ ed up@@ on h@@ im@@ .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in s@@ uch a st@@ ate of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first l@@ ess@@ on at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his ey@@ es, he was lo@@ st@@ .
And he was tal@@ king about in@@ vis@@ i@@ ble de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ k@@ e, and how some@@ one was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing hi@@ m in his s@@ le@@ ep@@ .
And I was af@@ ra@@ i@@ d, not for m@@ y@@ self@@ , but I was af@@ ra@@ id that I was going to l@@ ose h@@ im@@ , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ at@@ es, and that I would r@@ u@@ in his rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with the vi@@ ol@@ in if I started tal@@ king about sc@@ al@@ es and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ o@@ s and other ex@@ cit@@ ing form@@ s of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ ol@@ in pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ g@@ y.
So, I just started pla@@ y@@ ing.
And I pla@@ y@@ ed the first mo@@ ve@@ ment of the B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven V@@ i@@ ol@@ in Con@@ cer@@ to@@ .
And as I pla@@ y@@ ed, I underst@@ o@@ od that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ 's ey@@ es.
It was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some in@@ vis@@ i@@ ble ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ ut@@ ic@@ al, a ch@@ em@@ ical re@@ ac@@ tion@@ , for which my pla@@ ying the mus@@ ic was its cat@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ 's man@@ ic r@@ age was trans@@ form@@ ed into underst@@ and@@ ing, a qu@@ i@@ et cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and gr@@ ac@@ e.
And in a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ e, he lif@@ ted his own vi@@ ol@@ in and he started pla@@ y@@ ing, by ear@@ , cer@@ ta@@ in s@@ ni@@ p@@ pet@@ s of vi@@ ol@@ in con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then as@@ ked me to compl@@ e@@ te -- M@@ en@@ de@@ l@@ s@@ so@@ hn@@ , T@@ c@@ ha@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y, S@@ i@@ bel@@ i@@ us.
And we started tal@@ king about mus@@ ic, from B@@ ach to B@@ e@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ m@@ s, B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ n@@ er, all the B@@ '@@ s, from B@@ ar@@ t@@ ó@@ k, all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ e@@ k@@ k@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en@@ .
And I underst@@ o@@ od that he not only had an en@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ pe@@ di@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of mus@@ ic, but he rel@@ ated to this mus@@ ic at a person@@ al le@@ vel@@ .
He sp@@ o@@ ke about it with the kind of pas@@ sion and underst@@ and@@ ing that I sh@@ are with my col@@ lea@@ gu@@ es in the L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic.
And through pla@@ ying mus@@ ic and tal@@ king about mus@@ ic, this man had trans@@ form@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ d, dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ed man that had just come from w@@ al@@ king the st@@ re@@ et@@ s of do@@ wn@@ to@@ wn L@@ o@@ s An@@ g@@ el@@ es to the ch@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, er@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ e, br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ t, J@@ u@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tr@@ ain@@ ed mus@@ ici@@ an.
M@@ us@@ ic is medic@@ in@@ e. M@@ us@@ ic chang@@ es us.
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ , mus@@ ic is s@@ an@@ ity.
Because mus@@ ic al@@ low@@ s hi@@ m to take his thou@@ gh@@ ts and de@@ l@@ us@@ ion@@ s and s@@ ha@@ pe them through his imagin@@ ation and his cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y, into real@@ ity.
And that is an esc@@ ape from his tor@@ men@@ ted st@@ ate.
And I underst@@ o@@ od that this was the very es@@ sen@@ ce of ar@@ t.
This was the very reas@@ on why we made mus@@ ic, that we take something that exist@@ s with@@ in all of us at our very fund@@ ament@@ al co@@ re, our emo@@ tion@@ s, and through our ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic l@@ en@@ s, through our cre@@ ati@@ vit@@ y, we're able to s@@ ha@@ pe those emo@@ tions into real@@ ity.
And the real@@ ity of that ex@@ pres@@ sion re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us, in@@ sp@@ i@@ res and un@@ it@@ es us.
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ , mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght hi@@ m back into a fol@@ d of fri@@ en@@ d@@ s.
The re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tive pow@@ er of mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght hi@@ m back into a famil@@ y of mus@@ ici@@ ans that underst@@ o@@ od h@@ im@@ , that re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed his tal@@ ents and re@@ spec@@ ted h@@ im@@ .
And I will al@@ ways make mus@@ ic with N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ , wh@@ e@@ ther we're at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all or on S@@ ki@@ d R@@ o@@ w, because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I bec@@ ame a mus@@ ici@@ an.
Thank you.
B@@ r@@ un@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani@@ : Thank you. Th@@ an@@ k@@ s.
R@@ ob@@ er@@ t G@@ u@@ pt@@ a.
R@@ ob@@ er@@ t G@@ up@@ ta@@ : I'm going to pla@@ y something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cel@@ li@@ st@@ s.
So, pl@@ ea@@ se for@@ give m@@ e.
I'm J@@ ane M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a g@@ ame desig@@ n@@ er.
I've been ma@@ king g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine now for 10 year@@ s,
and my go@@ al for the next dec@@ a@@ de is to try to make it as eas@@ y to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ a@@ il@@ s con@@ vin@@ c@@ ing more peopl@@ e, in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding all of you@@ , to sp@@ end more time pla@@ ying bi@@ gg@@ er and better g@@ am@@ es.
R@@ i@@ ght now we sp@@ end three bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
S@@ ome of you might be thin@@ k@@ ing, "@@ That's a lot of time to sp@@ end pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es.
M@@ a@@ ybe to@@ o much tim@@ e, consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s we have to sol@@ ve in the real worl@@ d@@ ."
But actu@@ ally, ac@@ cor@@ ding to my re@@ sear@@ ch at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tr@@ u@@ e.
Th@@ re@@ e bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k is not ne@@ ar@@ ly en@@ ough g@@ ame pla@@ y to sol@@ ve the worl@@ d@@ 's most ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
In fac@@ t, I belie@@ ve that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cent@@ ur@@ y on this plan@@ et, we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
I've cal@@ cul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s of g@@ ame pla@@ y every we@@ e@@ k.
So, that's probab@@ ly a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ iti@@ ve ide@@ a,
so I'@@ ll say it again@@ , le@@ t it sin@@ k in@@ :
If we want to sol@@ ve problem@@ s like h@@ un@@ g@@ er, po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, cl@@ im@@ ate chang@@ e, glob@@ al con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, ob@@ es@@ ity, I belie@@ ve that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es on@@ l@@ ine for at lea@@ st 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k, by the end of the next dec@@ a@@ de. No@@ . I'm ser@@ i@@ ou@@ s. I am@@ .
H@@ ere's wh@@ y. This pic@@ ture pret@@ ty much sum@@ s up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al to the f@@ ut@@ ure sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of the human speci@@ es.
T@@ r@@ ul@@ y. This is a por@@ tra@@ it by p@@ ho@@ to@@ grap@@ her P@@ hi@@ l T@@ ol@@ ed@@ an@@ o.
He wan@@ ted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of g@@ am@@ ing,
so he se@@ t up a cam@@ era in fr@@ on@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers wh@@ ile they were pla@@ y@@ ing.
And this is a clas@@ si@@ c g@@ am@@ ing emo@@ tion.
Now, if you're not a g@@ am@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this p@@ ho@@ to@@ .
You probab@@ ly see the sen@@ se of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y, a little bit of fe@@ ar, but in@@ ten@@ se con@@ centr@@ ation, de@@ ep@@ , de@@ ep fo@@ cu@@ s on t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing a really diff@@ icul@@ t problem@@ .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er, you will no@@ t@@ ice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here@@ : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up@@ , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a sig@@ n of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m,
and the ey@@ e@@ b@@ ro@@ ws up is sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
This is a g@@ am@@ er wh@@ o@@ 's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ ."
O@@ h, you@@ 've hear@@ d of that.
O@@ K@@ , go@@ o@@ d, so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us.
A@@ n e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y pos@@ iti@@ ve, you had no idea it was even possi@@ ble un@@ ti@@ l you ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ved it.
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ ond the thre@@ sh@@ old of imagin@@ ation, and when you get the@@ re,
you're sho@@ c@@ ked to di@@ sco@@ ver what you're tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ able of@@ . That's an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
And this is the face that we need to see on mil@@ li@@ ons of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cent@@ ur@@ y --
the face of some@@ one wh@@ o, again@@ st all od@@ ds, is on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
Now, un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
This is what I c@@ all the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ o@@ od A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is actually me ma@@ king it. C@@ an you se@@ e? Y@@ es. G@@ oo@@ d.
This is me ma@@ king the "@@ I'm No@@ t G@@ o@@ od A@@ t L@@ i@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is a pi@@ ec@@ e of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od
in B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ e@@ y, C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, where I did my P@@ h@@ D on why we're better in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real lif@@ e.
And this is a prob@@ le@@ m that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers ha@@ ve.
We fe@@ el that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in g@@ am@@ es.
I don't m@@ ean just good as in suc@@ ces@@ s@@ f@@ ul, al@@ th@@ ough that's part of it. We do ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more in g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s. But I also m@@ ean good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ter@@ s -- in@@ sp@@ i@@ red to col@@ l@@ abor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.
And when we're in g@@ ame worl@@ ds, I belie@@ ve that many of us bec@@ ome the b@@ est ver@@ sion of our@@ sel@@ ves -- the most lik@@ ely to hel@@ p at a mom@@ ent@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, the most lik@@ ely to st@@ ic@@ k with a prob@@ le@@ m as l@@ ong at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again@@ .
And in real lif@@ e, when we face fa@@ il@@ u@@ re, when we con@@ fr@@ on@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we of@@ ten don't fe@@ el that wa@@ y.
We fe@@ el o@@ ver@@ com@@ e, we fe@@ el o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d,
we fe@@ el an@@ x@@ i@@ ou@@ s, ma@@ ybe de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, fr@@ u@@ str@@ ated or c@@ y@@ n@@ ic@@ al.
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s when we're pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, they just don't ex@@ ist in g@@ am@@ es.
So that's what I wan@@ ted to stu@@ dy when I was a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate stu@@ dent@@ .
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ possi@@ ble to fe@@ el that we can't ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s from g@@ am@@ es and ap@@ pl@@ y them to real@@ -@@ world wor@@ k@@ ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al col@@ l@@ abor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ .
And I started to no@@ t@@ ice a few things that make e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s so possi@@ ble in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es, es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t, there are lo@@ ts and lo@@ ts of different ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s who are w@@ ill@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a worl@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ si@@ on, right a@@ wa@@ y.
But not just any mis@@ si@@ on, it's a mis@@ sion that is per@@ f@@ ect@@ ly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your cur@@ ren@@ t le@@ ve@@ l in the g@@ am@@ e.
R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? So you can do it.
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you can't ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of@@ , so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ empl@@ o@@ y@@ ment in W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t@@ ; no sit@@ ting aro@@ un@@ d,
wr@@ ing@@ ing your han@@ ds --
there's al@@ ways something speci@@ fi@@ c and important to be don@@ e.
There are also t@@ ons of col@@ l@@ abor@@ at@@ or@@ s.
E@@ very@@ where you go@@ , h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of people read@@ y to work with you to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve your e@@ pi@@ c mis@@ si@@ on.
That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ il@@ y, this sen@@ se that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ tip@@ s are t@@ ons of col@@ l@@ abor@@ at@@ or@@ s.
And there's this e@@ pi@@ c st@@ or@@ y, this in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing st@@ ory of why we're the@@ re, and what we're do@@ ing,
and we get all this pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k.
You gu@@ ys have hear@@ d of le@@ vel@@ ing up@@ , +@@ 1 st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ , +@@ 1 intel@@ li@@ gen@@ ce.
We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
When I get off this st@@ ag@@ e, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 sp@@ ea@@ k@@ ing, and +@@ 1 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a, +@@ 20 c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real lif@@ e.
Now, the prob@@ le@@ m with col@@ l@@ abor@@ ative on@@ l@@ ine en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s like W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t is that it's so s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in all the tim@@ e, we deci@@ de to sp@@ end all our time in these g@@ ame worl@@ d@@ s.
It's just better than real@@ ity.
So, so f@@ ar, col@@ l@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely all the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 mil@@ lion years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tu@@ al problem@@ s of A@@ z@@ er@@ oth@@ .
Now, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y a b@@ ad thing@@ .
It might so@@ und like it's a b@@ ad thing@@ .
But to put that in con@@ tex@@ t@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 mil@@ lion years ag@@ o was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human an@@ ce@@ st@@ or@@ s st@@ o@@ od up@@ .
That was the first u@@ pri@@ ght prim@@ ate.
So when we talk about how much time we're cur@@ ren@@ t@@ ly in@@ vest@@ ing in pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, the only way it ma@@ kes sen@@ se to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolu@@ tion@@ , which is an ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing@@ .
But it's also ap@@ t, because it tur@@ n@@ s out that by sp@@ en@@ ding all this time pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, we're actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ing@@ s.
We@@ 're evol@@ ving to be a more col@@ l@@ abor@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es.
This is tr@@ u@@ e. I belie@@ ve this.
So, consi@@ der this really interest@@ ing st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ ;
it was rec@@ ent@@ ly publi@@ sh@@ ed by a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ g@@ ie M@@ ell@@ on U@@ ni@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ :
The a@@ ver@@ age y@@ oun@@ g per@@ son to@@ day in a coun@@ try with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have sp@@ ent 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1@@ .
Now 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interest@@ ing num@@ ber for two reas@@ on@@ s.
F@@ ir@@ st of all@@ , for childre@@ n in the Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es, 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of time you will sp@@ end in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to hi@@ gh sch@@ oo@@ l gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ation, if you have per@@ f@@ ect at@@ ten@@ d@@ an@@ ce.
So, we have an enti@@ re par@@ al@@ le@@ l tr@@ ac@@ k of educ@@ ation going on, where y@@ oun@@ g people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they're lear@@ ning about every@@ thing el@@ se in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
S@@ ome of you have probab@@ ly re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ w@@ ell@@ 's new bo@@ ok "@@ O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ,"
so you would have hear@@ d of his the@@ ory of suc@@ ces@@ s, the "@@ 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s@@ " the@@ ory of suc@@ ces@@ s.
It's bas@@ ed on this great co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ scien@@ ce re@@ sear@@ ch that sa@@ ys if we can ma@@ st@@ er 1@@ 0@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of ef@@ for@@ t@@ ful stu@@ dy at any@@ thing by the age of 2@@ 1@@ , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at it.
We will be as good at wh@@ ate@@ ver we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the worl@@ d.
And so@@ , now what we're looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ oun@@ g people who are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So, the big quest@@ ion is, "@@ What ex@@ act@@ ly are g@@ am@@ ers get@@ ting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could fi@@ g@@ ure that ou@@ t, we would have a vir@@ tu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted human res@@ our@@ ce on our h@@ and@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who sp@@ end at lea@@ st an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ l@@ ine g@@ am@@ es.
Th@@ ese are our vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ er@@ s,
5@@ 00 mil@@ lion people who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at some@@ thing@@ .
And in the next dec@@ a@@ de, we're going to have another bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y good at wh@@ ate@@ ver that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing.
The g@@ ame indu@@ str@@ y is devel@@ op@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energ@@ y and that work with the wi@@ rel@@ ess ph@@ one n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks inst@@ ea@@ d of b@@ ro@@ ad@@ b@@ and In@@ tern@@ et, so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the worl@@ d, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in Indi@@ a, Ch@@ in@@ a, B@@ ra@@ z@@ il@@ , can get on@@ lin@@ e.
They ex@@ p@@ ect one bil@@ lion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next dec@@ a@@ de.
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 bil@@ lion g@@ am@@ er@@ s.
So I've started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are ma@@ king us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at.
H@@ ere are the f@@ our things I came up with@@ . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m.
O@@ K@@ , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me self@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m is the de@@ si@@ re to act im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ac@@ k@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ e, com@@ bin@@ ed with the belie@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able ho@@ pe of suc@@ ces@@ s.
G@@ am@@ ers al@@ ways belie@@ ve that an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is possi@@ bl@@ e, and that it's al@@ ways wor@@ th tr@@ y@@ ing, and trying no@@ w.
G@@ am@@ ers don't s@@ it aro@@ un@@ d.
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o@@ s at w@@ ea@@ ving a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic.
Th@@ ere's a lot of interest@@ ing re@@ sear@@ ch that sho@@ ws we like people better after we pla@@ y a g@@ ame with the@@ m, even if they@@ 've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ l@@ y.
And the reas@@ on is, it ta@@ kes a lot of tr@@ ust to pla@@ y a g@@ ame with some@@ on@@ e.
We tr@@ ust that they will sp@@ end their time with us, that they will pla@@ y by the same r@@ ul@@ es, val@@ ue the same go@@ al, sta@@ y with the g@@ ame un@@ ti@@ l it's o@@ ver@@ .
And so@@ , pla@@ ying a g@@ ame toge@@ ther actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation.
And we actually buil@@ d str@@ ong@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s as a res@@ ul@@ t.
B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity. I lo@@ ve it.
You know, there's a reas@@ on why the a@@ ver@@ age W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time j@@ ob@@ .
It's because we know, when we're pla@@ ying a g@@ am@@ e, that we're actually hap@@ pi@@ er wor@@ king har@@ d than we are re@@ la@@ x@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing ou@@ t.
We know that we are op@@ tim@@ iz@@ ed as human be@@ ing@@ s, to do har@@ d and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful wor@@ k.
And g@@ am@@ ers are w@@ ill@@ ing to work har@@ d all the tim@@ e, if they're gi@@ ven the right wor@@ k.
F@@ in@@ all@@ y@@ : e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers lo@@ ve to be at@@ t@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale st@@ ori@@ es.
So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ p@@ s put that into per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve@@ :
So, you all know W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a, bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the worl@@ d.
S@@ ec@@ ond bi@@ gg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the worl@@ d, with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es, is the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t wi@@ k@@ i.
F@@ i@@ ve mil@@ lion people use it every mon@@ th@@ .
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more inform@@ ation about W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t on the In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t than any other to@@ pi@@ c co@@ ve@@ red on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the worl@@ d.
They are buil@@ ding an e@@ pi@@ c st@@ or@@ y.
They are buil@@ ding an e@@ pi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge res@@ our@@ ce about the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, so these are f@@ our su@@ per@@ pow@@ ers that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ :
G@@ am@@ ers are su@@ per@@ -@@ em@@ pow@@ ere@@ d ho@@ pe@@ ful indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al@@ s.
Th@@ ese are people who belie@@ ve that they are indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the worl@@ d.
And the only prob@@ le@@ m is, they belie@@ ve that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real worl@@ d.
That's the prob@@ le@@ m that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.
Th@@ ere's an econom@@ ist n@@ am@@ ed E@@ d@@ war@@ d C@@ astr@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a.
H@@ is work is br@@ il@@ li@@ an@@ t. He loo@@ ks at why people are in@@ vest@@ ing so much time and energ@@ y and mon@@ ey in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ d@@ s.
And he sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ We@@ 're wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what am@@ oun@@ ts to no less than a ma@@ s@@ s ex@@ o@@ dus to vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds and on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s@@ ."
And he@@ 's an econom@@ ist@@ , so he@@ 's r@@ ation@@ al.
And he sa@@ ys -- No@@ t like me, I'm a g@@ ame desig@@ ner@@ ; I'm ex@@ ub@@ er@@ an@@ t.
But he sa@@ ys that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sen@@ se, because g@@ am@@ ers can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve more in on@@ l@@ ine worl@@ ds than they can in real lif@@ e.
They can have str@@ ong@@ er soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real li@@ fe@@ ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and fe@@ el more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real lif@@ e.
So he sa@@ y@@ s, for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sen@@ se for g@@ am@@ ers to sp@@ end more time in vir@@ tu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real worl@@ d.
Now, I also ag@@ re@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for no@@ w.
But it is no@@ t, by any me@@ an@@ s, an op@@ tim@@ al s@@ itu@@ ation.
We have to start ma@@ king the real world work more like a g@@ am@@ e.
I take my in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ation from something that happen@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ag@@ o.
Th@@ ese are an@@ ci@@ ent dic@@ e, made out of sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ l@@ es.
B@@ e@@ fore we had a@@ w@@ es@@ ome g@@ ame control@@ l@@ er@@ s, we had sh@@ e@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ l@@ es.
And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first g@@ ame e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ ment desig@@ ned by human be@@ ing@@ s,
and if you're famil@@ iar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ e@@ k h@@ ist@@ ori@@ an H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, you might know this h@@ ist@@ or@@ y,
which is the h@@ ist@@ ory of who in@@ ven@@ ted g@@ am@@ es and wh@@ y.
H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s sa@@ ys that g@@ am@@ es, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly d@@ ice g@@ am@@ es, were in@@ ven@@ ted in the k@@ ing@@ do@@ m of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, dur@@ ing a time of fam@@ in@@ e.
A@@ p@@ p@@ aren@@ t@@ ly, there was s@@ uch a se@@ ver@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a deci@@ ded they had to do something c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing. P@@ e@@ o@@ ple were fi@@ ght@@ ing.
It was an ex@@ tre@@ me s@@ itu@@ ation, they ne@@ e@@ ded an ex@@ tre@@ me solu@@ tion.
So, ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they in@@ ven@@ ted d@@ ice g@@ am@@ es, and they se@@ t up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de pol@@ ic@@ y@@ :
O@@ n one day, every@@ body would e@@ at,
and on the next day, every@@ body would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pla@@ ying the d@@ ice g@@ am@@ es, because g@@ am@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in s@@ uch s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ y@@ ing, bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fac@@ t that they had no fo@@ od to e@@ at.
And then on the next day, they would pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es@@ ; and on the next day, they would e@@ at.
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they pas@@ s@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this wa@@ y, sur@@ vi@@ ving through a fam@@ in@@ e, by e@@ ating on one day, and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is ex@@ act@@ ly, I thin@@ k, how we're using g@@ am@@ es to@@ da@@ y. We@@ 're using g@@ am@@ es to esc@@ ape real@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing --
we're using g@@ am@@ es to get a@@ way
from every@@ thing that's b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in the real en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ , every@@ thing that's not s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ ying about real lif@@ e, and we're get@@ ting what we need from g@@ am@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end the@@ re.
This is really ex@@ cit@@ ing.
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine was@@ n't get@@ ting bet@@ ter@@ ,
so the king deci@@ ded they would pla@@ y one fin@@ al d@@ ice g@@ am@@ e.
They di@@ vi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ do@@ m in hal@@ f@@ .
They pla@@ y@@ ed one d@@ ice g@@ am@@ e, and the w@@ in@@ n@@ ers of that g@@ ame got to go on an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ re.
They would lea@@ ve L@@ y@@ di@@ a,
and they would go out in sear@@ ch of a new place to li@@ ve, lea@@ ving be@@ h@@ ind just en@@ ough people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the res@@ our@@ ces that were av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly to take their ci@@ v@@ iliz@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ ri@@ ve.
Now, this so@@ un@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y, ri@@ ght@@ ?
But rec@@ ent@@ ly, D@@ N@@ A e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then l@@ ed to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.
And so@@ , rec@@ ent@@ ly, scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s have su@@ gg@@ est@@ ed that H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' c@@ ra@@ z@@ y st@@ ory is actually tr@@ u@@ e.
And ge@@ olog@@ ist@@ s have found e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of a glob@@ al co@@ ol@@ ing that l@@ ast@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 year@@ s, that could have expl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ in@@ e.
So this c@@ ra@@ z@@ y st@@ ory might be tr@@ u@@ e.
They might have actually sa@@ ved their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, and then been so in@@ sp@@ i@@ re@@ d, and k@@ new so much about how to come toge@@ ther with g@@ am@@ es, that they actually sa@@ ved the enti@@ re ci@@ v@@ iliz@@ ation that wa@@ y.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, we can do that.
We@@ 've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4@@ .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y g@@ ame from the W@@ or@@ ld of W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t ser@@ i@@ es. That was 1@@ 6 years ag@@ o.
They pla@@ y@@ ed d@@ ice g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 year@@ s, we've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ c@@ ra@@ f@@ t for 1@@ 6 year@@ s.
I say we are read@@ y for our own e@@ pi@@ c g@@ am@@ e.
Now, they had hal@@ f the ci@@ v@@ iliz@@ ation go off in sear@@ ch of a new worl@@ d,
so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 bil@@ lion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k of g@@ am@@ e-@@ pla@@ y fr@@ om@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's get hal@@ f of us to ag@@ re@@ e to sp@@ end an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es, un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.
Now, I know you're as@@ k@@ ing, "@@ How are we going to sol@@ ve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s in g@@ am@@ es@@ ?" Well, that's what I've de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the p@@ ast few year@@ s, at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We have this ban@@ ne@@ r in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to@@ , and it ex@@ pres@@ s@@ es our vie@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
What we want to do is make the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We want to imag@@ ine the b@@ est@@ -@@ c@@ ase sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ com@@ e,
and then we want to em@@ pow@@ er people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity.
We want to imag@@ ine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s, and then give people the me@@ ans to ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in.
I'm just going to very b@@ ri@@ ef@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I've made that are an at@@ tem@@ p@@ t to give people the me@@ ans to cre@@ ate e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in@@ s in their own f@@ ut@@ u@@ re@@ s.
This is W@@ or@@ ld W@@ i@@ th@@ out O@@ il@@ .
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an on@@ l@@ ine g@@ ame in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ ag@@ e. The o@@ il sh@@ or@@ t@@ age is fic@@ tion@@ al,
but we put en@@ ough on@@ l@@ ine con@@ t@@ ent out there for you to belie@@ ve that it's re@@ al, and to li@@ ve your real life as if we've r@@ un out of o@@ il@@ . So when you come to the g@@ am@@ e, you sig@@ n up@@ , tell us where you li@@ ve,
and then we give you real@@ -@@ time ne@@ ws vide@@ os@@ , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you ex@@ act@@ ly how much o@@ il co@@ st@@ s, wh@@ at's not av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e, how fo@@ od sup@@ pl@@ y is being a@@ ff@@ ec@@ te@@ d, how tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation is being a@@ ff@@ ec@@ te@@ d, if sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s are cl@@ os@@ ed, if there's ri@@ o@@ t@@ ing,
and you have to fi@@ g@@ ure out how you would li@@ ve your real life as if this were tr@@ u@@ e. And then we as@@ k you to b@@ lo@@ g about it, to p@@ ost vide@@ os@@ , to p@@ ost p@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ .
We p@@ il@@ o@@ ted this g@@ ame with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ ,
and we've tr@@ ac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ ce.
And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative experien@@ ce.
No@@ body w@@ ant@@ s to change how they li@@ ve, just because it's good for the worl@@ d, or because we're sup@@ pos@@ ed to@@ .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure and tell the@@ m, "@@ We@@ 've r@@ un out of o@@ il@@ .
This is an a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing st@@ ory and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you@@ r@@ sel@@ f to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve@@ ,"
most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have ke@@ p@@ t up the ha@@ b@@ its that they lear@@ ned in this g@@ am@@ e.
So for the next worl@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving g@@ am@@ e, we deci@@ ded to a@@ im hi@@ gh@@ er -- bi@@ gg@@ er prob@@ le@@ m than just p@@ ea@@ k o@@ il@@ .
We did a g@@ ame called S@@ u@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ itu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
And the pre@@ mis@@ e was@@ , a su@@ per@@ com@@ pute@@ r has cal@@ cul@@ ated that h@@ um@@ ans have only 2@@ 3 years le@@ f@@ t on the plan@@ et.
This su@@ per@@ com@@ pute@@ r was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ w@@ aren@@ ess S@@ y@@ st@@ em@@ , of cour@@ s@@ e.
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ l@@ ine -- al@@ most like a J@@ er@@ r@@ y B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ vi@@ e.
You know J@@ er@@ r@@ y B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er mo@@ vi@@ es, you for@@ m a dre@@ am te@@ am --
you@@ 've got the astr@@ on@@ a@@ ut@@ , the scien@@ ti@@ st@@ , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ v@@ ic@@ t, and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the worl@@ d.
But in our g@@ am@@ e, inst@@ ea@@ d of just ha@@ ving fi@@ ve people on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , we said, "@@ E@@ very@@ bo@@ d@@ y@@ 's on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , and it's your jo@@ b to inv@@ ent the f@@ ut@@ ure of energ@@ y, the f@@ ut@@ ure of fo@@ o@@ d, the f@@ ut@@ ure of heal@@ th@@ , the f@@ ut@@ ure of sec@@ ur@@ ity and the f@@ ut@@ ure of the soci@@ al sa@@ f@@ et@@ y n@@ et@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people pla@@ y that g@@ ame for ei@@ ght we@@ e@@ k@@ s.
They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative solu@@ tions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, G@@ oo@@ g@@ le "@@ S@@ u@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.
So, fin@@ ally, the last g@@ am@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a g@@ ame d@@ one with the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te. If you compl@@ e@@ te the g@@ am@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the W@@ or@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itu@@ te as a S@@ o@@ ci@@ al In@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or, clas@@ s of 20@@ 1@@ 0@@ .
W@@ or@@ king with univers@@ iti@@ es all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afr@@ ic@@ a, and we are in@@ vit@@ ing them to lear@@ n soci@@ al in@@ no@@ v@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s.
We@@ 've got a grap@@ hi@@ c no@@ vel@@ , we've got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like loc@@ al in@@ si@@ ght, kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge n@@ et@@ wor@@ k@@ ing, su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity, vis@@ ion and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ n@@ es@@ s.
I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to pl@@ ea@@ se sh@@ are this g@@ ame with y@@ oun@@ g peopl@@ e, any@@ where in the worl@@ d, partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in devel@@ op@@ ing are@@ as@@ , who might b@@ en@@ ef@@ it from com@@ ing toge@@ ther to try to start to imag@@ ine their own soci@@ al ent@@ er@@ pr@@ is@@ es to sa@@ ve the worl@@ d.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up no@@ w.
I want to as@@ k a quest@@ ion@@ .
What do you think happen@@ s nex@@ t@@ ?
We@@ 've got all these a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing g@@ am@@ er@@ s, we've got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of p@@ il@@ o@@ ts of what we might do@@ , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world y@@ et.
W@@ ell I ho@@ pe you will ag@@ re@@ e with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world wor@@ k, that g@@ am@@ es are a pow@@ er@@ ful pl@@ at@@ for@@ m for chang@@ e.
We have all these a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing su@@ per@@ pow@@ er@@ s@@ : bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, the abil@@ ity to w@@ ea@@ ve a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ r@@ ic, this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m and the de@@ si@@ re for e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing.
I really ho@@ pe that we can come toge@@ ther to pla@@ y g@@ am@@ es that mat@@ ter@@ , to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another cent@@ ur@@ y.
That's my ho@@ p@@ e, that you will jo@@ in me in ma@@ king and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es like this.
When I look for@@ war@@ d to the next dec@@ a@@ de, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any f@@ ut@@ ure we can imagin@@ e, and we can pla@@ y any g@@ am@@ es we wan@@ t, so I sa@@ y@@ :
L@@ et the worl@@ d@@ -@@ chang@@ ing g@@ am@@ es be@@ gin@@ .
Thank you.
F@@ or some time I have been interest@@ ed in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, which might se@@ em like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interest@@ ed in, un@@ less you think of it in the ter@@ m@@ s that I do@@ , which is, "@@ S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is belie@@ ved in en@@ ough by some@@ body that it bec@@ om@@ es something real@@ ."
In other wor@@ ds, su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s have a m@@ ea@@ sur@@ able eff@@ ect in cer@@ ta@@ in k@@ in@@ ds of studi@@ es, the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t, just because the per@@ son thin@@ ks that wh@@ at's happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for pa@@ in man@@ ag@@ em@@ ent, for exam@@ pl@@ e, if they belie@@ ve it en@@ ough there is a m@@ ea@@ sur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ec@@ t.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke bec@@ om@@ es something real because of some@@ on@@ e's per@@ cep@@ tion of it.
In or@@ der for us to underst@@ and each oth@@ er, I want to start by sho@@ w@@ ing you a r@@ u@@ d@@ iment@@ ar@@ y, very sim@@ ple ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ic@@ k.
And I'm going to show you how it wor@@ k@@ s. This is a tr@@ ic@@ k that's been in every childre@@ n@@ 's ma@@ gi@@ c bo@@ ok sin@@ ce at lea@@ st the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s.
I lear@@ ned it m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.
I'@@ ll do it for you@@ , and then I'@@ ll expl@@ a@@ in it.
And then I'@@ ll expl@@ a@@ in why I expl@@ ain@@ ed it.
So, here@@ 's what happen@@ s.
The k@@ ni@@ f@@ e, which you can exam@@ in@@ e@@ ; my han@@ d, which you could exam@@ in@@ e.
I'm just going to h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in my f@@ ist like this.
I'@@ ll get my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve bac@@ k.
And to make sur@@ e no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve I'm just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze my w@@ ris@@ t right here@@ .
That way you can see that at no time
can any@@ thing tr@@ av@@ el@@ , as l@@ ong as I'm s@@ qu@@ e@@ ez@@ ing there no@@ thing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve.
And the ob@@ j@@ ect of this is qu@@ ite simpl@@ e.
I'm going to op@@ en my han@@ d, and ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly, if all is w@@ ell, my p@@ ure anim@@ al mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e.
In fac@@ t it's hel@@ d so ti@@ ght@@ ly in place that I can s@@ ha@@ ke it, and the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e does not come off@@ .
No@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, no tr@@ ick@@ er@@ y. And you can exam@@ ine every@@ thing@@ .
T@@ a@@ -@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tr@@ ic@@ k that I of@@ ten te@@ ach to y@@ oun@@ g childre@@ n that are interest@@ ed in mag@@ ic, because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ cep@@ tion by stu@@ d@@ ying this very -- even th@@ ough it's a very sim@@ ple tr@@ ic@@ k me@@ th@@ od@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
Pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly many of you in the ro@@ om know this tr@@ ic@@ k.
What happen@@ s is this.
I h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e in my han@@ d.
I say I'm going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ ris@@ t to make sur@@ e no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reas@@ on I'm h@@ ol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ris@@ t is because that's actually the sec@@ re@@ t of the ill@@ us@@ ion@@ .
In a mom@@ ent when my h@@ and mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being a@@ way from you@@ , this f@@ ing@@ er right here@@ , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ f@@ t from where it is, to a pos@@ iti@@ on poin@@ ting out like this.
N@@ ice on@@ e.
S@@ om@@ e@@ one who didn't have a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is out the@@ re.
So, it go@@ es like this, from here@@ , ri@@ gh@@ t.
And as I mo@@ ve around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ f@@ t@@ s.
And we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tiv@@ e, why you don't no@@ t@@ ice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here@@ , because the min@@ d, and the way it proces@@ s@@ es inform@@ ation, it doesn't coun@@ t, on@@ e, tw@@ o, thre@@ e. It gr@@ ou@@ p@@ s them.
But that's not really what this is ab@@ ou@@ t. R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? And then I op@@ en my h@@ and up@@ .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it's cl@@ ing@@ ing the@@ re, not by anim@@ al mag@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m, but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being the@@ re.
And then when I cl@@ ose my f@@ ing@@ er, same thing@@ , as I mo@@ ve bac@@ k, this mo@@ tion kind of co@@ ver@@ s the mo@@ ving back of my f@@ ing@@ er.
I take this h@@ and a@@ wa@@ y. You give the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e ou@@ t.
There is a tr@@ ic@@ k you can do for your fri@@ en@@ ds and ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s. Th@@ an@@ k@@ s.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect@@ ?
I re@@ ad a stu@@ dy a y@@ ear or so ag@@ o that really b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d wi@@ de o@@ pen@@ .
I'm not a do@@ c@@ t@@ or or a re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing thing@@ .
It tur@@ n@@ s out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the for@@ m of a wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ , that's like as@@ pi@@ r@@ in s@@ hap@@ ed -- it's just a ro@@ und wh@@ ite p@@ ill -- it has some cer@@ ta@@ in m@@ ea@@ sur@@ able eff@@ ec@@ t.
But if you change the for@@ m that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in, like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ ill@@ , and col@@ or it bl@@ u@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it, it is actually m@@ ea@@ sur@@ ab@@ ly more eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve.
E@@ ven th@@ ough ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical -- they're su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s.
But a wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ ue p@@ ill@@ .
Wh@@ at@@ ? That really f@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed me ou@@ t.
T@@ ur@@ n@@ s out thou@@ gh@@ , that that's not even where it st@@ op@@ s.
If you have cap@@ s@@ ul@@ es, they're more eff@@ ec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ let@@ s in any form@@ .
A c@@ olo@@ red cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, that's y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e.
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this.
O@@ ne p@@ ill tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three p@@ ill@@ s -- I don't re@@ mem@@ ber the st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic no@@ w. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.
But the poin@@ t is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ag@@ es have something to do with it.
And the for@@ m has something to do with it.
And if you want the ultim@@ ate in plac@@ e@@ bo@@ , you@@ 've go to the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
R@@ i@@ ght@@ ? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ er@@ t -- a c@@ ou@@ ple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ er@@ t some@@ thing@@ , and you in@@ j@@ ect this into a p@@ ati@@ ent ...
W@@ ell this is s@@ uch a pow@@ er@@ ful imag@@ e in their min@@ d, it's so much str@@ ong@@ er than the wh@@ ite p@@ ill@@ .
It's a re@@ ally, this grap@@ h, w@@ ell I'@@ ll show it to you some other time when we have s@@ li@@ de@@ s.
The poin@@ t is the wh@@ ite p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ ue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e is not as good as the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ ut@@ ical qu@@ al@@ ity,
it's only your belie@@ f that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ ong@@ er eff@@ ec@@ t.
I wan@@ ted to see if I could take that idea and ap@@ pl@@ y it to a ma@@ gi@@ c tr@@ ic@@ k.
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tr@@ ic@@ k and make it se@@ em re@@ al.
And we know from that stu@@ dy that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the ne@@ ed@@ l@@ e.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in. It's ver@@ y, very sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ,
and I'm going to just st@@ er@@ iliz@@ e it a tin@@ y b@@ it.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h@@ . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h@@ .
That's my sk@@ in right the@@ re. This is not a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ o@@ od speci@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and r@@ un this ne@@ ed@@ le through to the other si@@ de.
If you're qu@@ eas@@ y -- if you fa@@ in@@ t eas@@ il@@ y -- I was doing this for some fri@@ en@@ ds in the ho@@ te@@ l ro@@ om last ni@@ ght, and some people that I didn't know, and one wom@@ an al@@ most pas@@ s@@ ed ou@@ t.
So, I su@@ gg@@ est if you get qu@@ eas@@ y eas@@ y that you look a@@ way for about the next 3@@ 0 -- in fac@@ t, you know wh@@ at, I'@@ ll do the first b@@ ad part be@@ h@@ ind it.
Y@@ ou@@ 'll get to se@@ e, you can look a@@ way to@@ o if you@@ '@@ d like to@@ .
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here@@ , the be@@ gin@@ ning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the low@@ er part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . Am I fre@@ a@@ king you out@@ ?
O@@ K@@ , and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.
Now, es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally we're in the same pos@@ iti@@ on we were in with the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e tr@@ ic@@ k.
S@@ or@@ t of@@ .
But you can't coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, le@@ t me show them to you. That's on@@ e, two thre@@ e, f@@ our@@ , fi@@ ve.
Y@@ es, w@@ ell@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go@@ , "@@ Well, he@@ 's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not d@@ um@@ b en@@ ough to sta@@ b h@@ im@@ sel@@ f through the sk@@ in to ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in us for a few minu@@ te@@ s. So, le@@ t me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.
Ho@@ w@@ 's that look out there@@ ? P@@ re@@ t@@ ty go@@ o@@ d.
Y@@ ea@@ h, I kno@@ w. And the people in the back go@@ , "@@ O@@ K@@ , I didn't really see that@@ ." P@@ e@@ o@@ ple in the s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite ro@@ om are star@@ ting to mo@@ ve in no@@ w.
L@@ et me give you good cl@@ ose look at this.
That really is my sk@@ in. That is not a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ o@@ od speci@@ al eff@@ ec@@ t.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ ist that aro@@ un@@ d.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're get@@ ting qu@@ eas@@ y, look a@@ wa@@ y, don't look at the thing@@ .
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple in the back or people on vide@@ o years from now wat@@ ch@@ ing this will go@@ , "@@ W@@ ell y@@ ea@@ h, that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect the@@ re, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole the@@ re, if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing. W@@ ell le@@ t me work up some b@@ loo@@ d for you.
Y@@ es, there it is.
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally no@@ w, I would take the ne@@ ed@@ le ou@@ t.
I would cl@@ ean off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no w@@ o@@ und@@ s.
But I think in this con@@ tex@@ t and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and ma@@ king it into something re@@ al, I'm just going to lea@@ ve it the@@ re, and w@@ alk off the st@@ ag@@ e.
I will be se@@ e@@ ing you se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es over the next few da@@ y@@ s.
I ho@@ pe you're looking for@@ war@@ d to that. Thank you very mu@@ ch@@ .
So, I've kno@@ wn a lot of f@@ is@@ h in my lif@@ e.
I've lo@@ ved only tw@@ o.
That first on@@ e, it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate a@@ ff@@ a@@ ir@@ .
It was a b@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful f@@ is@@ h@@ : fl@@ av@@ or@@ f@@ ul, tex@@ tu@@ re@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a b@@ est@@ s@@ ell@@ er on the men@@ u.
What a f@@ is@@ h@@ .
E@@ ven bet@@ ter@@ , it was f@@ ar@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ pos@@ ed hi@@ gh@@ est st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity.
So you could fe@@ el good about s@@ ell@@ ing it.
I was in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this b@@ ea@@ ut@@ y for se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ th@@ s.
O@@ ne day, the hea@@ d of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I'@@ d sp@@ ea@@ k at an ev@@ ent about the f@@ ar@@ m@@ 's su@@ st@@ ain@@ abil@@ ity.
"@@ A@@ b@@ sol@@ ut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
H@@ ere was a comp@@ any trying to sol@@ ve wh@@ at's bec@@ ome this un@@ imagin@@ able prob@@ le@@ m for us ch@@ ef@@ s@@ :
How do we ke@@ ep f@@ is@@ h on our men@@ us@@ ?
F@@ or the p@@ ast 50 year@@ s, we've been f@@ is@@ h@@ ing the sea@@ s like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ cut fo@@ rest@@ s.
It's har@@ d to o@@ ver@@ st@@ ate the de@@ struc@@ tion.
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of lar@@ ge f@@ is@@ h, the on@@ es we lo@@ ve -- the t@@ un@@ as@@ , the h@@ ali@@ b@@ ut@@ s, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ f@@ is@@ h -- they@@ 've col@@ l@@ ap@@ se@@ d.
Th@@ ere's al@@ most no@@ thing le@@ f@@ t.
So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
A lot of ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents again@@ st it@@ :
F@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ s pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent. T@@ a@@ ke t@@ un@@ a,
a maj@@ or d@@ ra@@ w@@ bac@@ k.
It's got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 1@@ 5 to on@@ e.
That me@@ ans it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ un@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d f@@ is@@ h to get you one po@@ und of f@@ ar@@ m t@@ un@@ a.
No@@ t very su@@ st@@ ain@@ abl@@ e.
It doesn't t@@ ast@@ e very good ei@@ th@@ er.
So here@@ , fin@@ ally, was a comp@@ any trying to do it ri@@ gh@@ t.
I wan@@ ted to sup@@ por@@ t them.
The day be@@ fore the ev@@ ent, I called the hea@@ d of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ an@@ y.
L@@ et@@ 's c@@ all hi@@ m D@@ on.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts str@@ ai@@ ght, you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing so f@@ ar out to sea@@ , you don't pol@@ lu@@ te@@ ."
"@@ That's ri@@ ght@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We@@ 're so f@@ ar ou@@ t, the w@@ ast@@ e from our f@@ is@@ h get@@ s di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te@@ d, not con@@ centr@@ ate@@ d@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ We@@ 're bas@@ ically a world un@@ to our@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the bus@@ in@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e, gre@@ at.
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 wh@@ at@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ G@@ re@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. G@@ o@@ t off the ph@@ on@@ e.
And that ni@@ ght, I was l@@ ying in be@@ d, and I thou@@ ght@@ : What the hel@@ l is a su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prote@@ in@@ ?
So the next day, just be@@ fore the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?" He sai@@ d he didn't kno@@ w. He would as@@ k aro@@ un@@ d.
Well, I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ;
no one could give me a str@@ ai@@ ght ans@@ w@@ er
un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally, I got on the ph@@ one with the hea@@ d bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's c@@ all hi@@ m D@@ on to@@ o.
"@@ D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?" Well, he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some f@@ is@@ h me@@ al@@ s, and then he sai@@ d ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Y@@ ea@@ h, f@@ ea@@ th@@ er@@ s, sk@@ in, b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ rap@@ s, d@@ ri@@ ed and proces@@ s@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."
I said, "@@ What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ k@@ ing, you know, two perc@@ ent.
"@@ Well, it's about 3@@ 0 perc@@ ent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "@@ D@@ on, wh@@ at's su@@ st@@ ain@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding ch@@ ick@@ en to f@@ is@@ h@@ ?"
There was a l@@ ong p@@ ause on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ Th@@ ere's just to@@ o much ch@@ ick@@ en in the worl@@ d@@ ."
I fel@@ l out of lo@@ ve with this f@@ is@@ h@@ .
No@@ , not because I'm some self@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ou@@ s, go@@ od@@ y@@ -@@ two sho@@ es fo@@ o@@ di@@ e.
I actually am@@ .
No@@ , I actually fel@@ l out of lo@@ ve with this f@@ is@@ h bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, I s@@ w@@ ear to G@@ o@@ d, after that con@@ vers@@ ation, the f@@ is@@ h t@@ ast@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en@@ .
This sec@@ ond f@@ is@@ h, it's a different kind of lo@@ ve st@@ or@@ y.
It's the r@@ om@@ an@@ tic k@@ in@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your f@@ is@@ h, you lo@@ ve the f@@ is@@ h@@ .
I first ate it at a rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n S@@ p@@ ain@@ .
A j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist fri@@ end had been tal@@ king about this f@@ is@@ h for a l@@ ong tim@@ e.
S@@ he kind of se@@ t us up@@ .
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ ri@@ ght, al@@ most sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, wh@@ ite col@@ or.
The ch@@ e@@ f had o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked it.
L@@ i@@ ke tw@@ ice o@@ ver@@ .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still de@@ l@@ ici@@ ou@@ s.
Wh@@ o can make a f@@ is@@ h t@@ ast@@ e good after it's been o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ke@@ d@@ ?
I can@@ '@@ t, but this gu@@ y can@@ .
L@@ et@@ 's c@@ all hi@@ m M@@ i@@ gu@@ el --
actually his n@@ ame is M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
And no@@ , he didn't co@@ ok the f@@ is@@ h, and he@@ 's not a ch@@ ef@@ ,
at lea@@ st in the way that you and I underst@@ and it.
H@@ e's a bi@@ olog@@ ist at V@@ et@@ a La P@@ al@@ ma@@ .
It's a f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est@@ er@@ n cor@@ ne@@ r of S@@ p@@ ain@@ .
It's at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, the f@@ ar@@ m was in the han@@ ds of the Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ i@@ an@@ s.
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f cat@@ tle on what was es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s.
They did it by d@@ ra@@ in@@ ing the l@@ an@@ d.
They buil@@ t this intr@@ ic@@ ate ser@@ i@@ es of can@@ al@@ s, and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed wat@@ er off the l@@ and and out into the ri@@ ver@@ .
Well, they c@@ oul@@ dn't make it wor@@ k, not econom@@ ic@@ all@@ y.
And ec@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally, it was a dis@@ ast@@ er.
It k@@ ill@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the bi@@ r@@ ds, wh@@ ic@@ h, for this plac@@ e, is a lot of bi@@ r@@ d@@ s.
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2@@ , a S@@ pan@@ is@@ h comp@@ any with an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al con@@ scien@@ ce p@@ ur@@ c@@ ha@@ s@@ ed the l@@ an@@ d.
What did they do@@ ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of wat@@ er.
They lit@@ er@@ ally f@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed the s@@ wit@@ ch@@ .
In@@ st@@ ea@@ d of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing wat@@ er ou@@ t, they used the ch@@ an@@ n@@ el@@ s to pul@@ l wat@@ er back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ al@@ s.
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m -- bas@@ s, mul@@ let@@ , sh@@ r@@ im@@ p@@ , e@@ el -- and in the proces@@ s, M@@ i@@ gu@@ el and this comp@@ any compl@@ et@@ ely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ olog@@ ical de@@ struc@@ tion.
The f@@ ar@@ m@@ 's incredi@@ bl@@ e.
I me@@ an, you@@ 've never se@@ en any@@ thing like this.
You st@@ are out at a h@@ or@@ iz@@ on that is a mil@@ lion mil@@ es a@@ wa@@ y, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ l@@ an@@ d.
I was there not l@@ ong ag@@ o with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
H@@ e's an a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing gu@@ y, like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ d@@ ile D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
O@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ ? There we are s@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s, and I'm p@@ ant@@ ing and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bi@@ olog@@ y l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
H@@ ere@@ , he@@ 's poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ sh@@ oul@@ de@@ red K@@ it@@ e.
Now, he@@ 's men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al ne@@ e@@ ds of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
And here@@ , here he se@@ es a gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ing pat@@ ter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds hi@@ m of the T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It tur@@ n@@ s ou@@ t, M@@ i@@ gu@@ el sp@@ ent the better part of his care@@ er in the M@@ i@@ k@@ um@@ i N@@ ation@@ al P@@ ar@@ k in Afr@@ ic@@ a.
I as@@ ked hi@@ m how he bec@@ ame s@@ uch an exper@@ t on f@@ is@@ h@@ .
He said, "@@ F@@ is@@ h@@ ? I didn't know any@@ thing about f@@ is@@ h@@ .
I'm an exper@@ t in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ ."
And then he@@ 's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are bi@@ r@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ ang@@ e a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c pl@@ ant@@ s.
And don't get me wr@@ ong@@ , that was really f@@ as@@ cin@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bi@@ o@@ tic commun@@ ity un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ge@@ d, kind of thing@@ .
It's gre@@ at, but I was in lo@@ ve.
And my hea@@ d was s@@ w@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked pi@@ ec@@ e of de@@ l@@ ici@@ ous f@@ is@@ h I had the ni@@ ght be@@ fo@@ re.
So I inter@@ r@@ up@@ ted h@@ im@@ . I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , what ma@@ kes your f@@ is@@ h t@@ ast@@ e so go@@ od@@ ?"
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e.
"@@ I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s@@ : It's a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing.
But what are your f@@ is@@ h e@@ at@@ ing@@ ?
Wh@@ at's the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he go@@ es on to tell me it's s@@ uch a r@@ ich syst@@ em that the f@@ is@@ h are e@@ ating what they@@ '@@ d be e@@ ating in the w@@ il@@ d.
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ e@@ ds the f@@ is@@ h@@ .
The syst@@ em is so heal@@ th@@ y, it's tot@@ ally self@@ -@@ re@@ ne@@ w@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver hear@@ d of a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s@@ ?
L@@ at@@ er that day, I was d@@ ri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , and I as@@ ked h@@ im@@ , I said, "@@ F@@ or a place that se@@ em@@ s so natur@@ al, un@@ like like any f@@ ar@@ m I'@@ d ever been at, how do you m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ?"
A@@ t that mom@@ ent, it was as if a fil@@ m direc@@ t@@ or called for a se@@ t chang@@ e.
And we ro@@ un@@ ded the cor@@ ne@@ r and sa@@ w the most a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing si@@ ght@@ : thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds and thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os@@ , a lit@@ er@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as f@@ ar as you could se@@ e.
"@@ That's suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ L@@ oo@@ k at their bel@@ li@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
Th@@ ey@@ 're f@@ east@@ ing@@ ."
F@@ east@@ ing@@ ? I was tot@@ ally con@@ f@@ us@@ ed.
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , are@@ n't they f@@ east@@ ing on your f@@ is@@ h@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ We l@@ ose 20 percent of our f@@ is@@ h and f@@ is@@ h eg@@ g@@ s to bi@@ r@@ d@@ s.
Well, last year@@ , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bi@@ r@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.
It's bec@@ om@@ e, to@@ day, the lar@@ g@@ est and one of the most important priv@@ ate bi@@ r@@ d s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ari@@ es in all of E@@ ur@@ o@@ pe@@ ."
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , is@@ n't a th@@ ri@@ ving bi@@ r@@ d popul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m@@ ?"
He sho@@ ok his hea@@ d, no@@ .
He said, "@@ We f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y, not in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
This is an ec@@ olog@@ ical n@@ et@@ wor@@ k.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ r@@ im@@ p@@ .
The sh@@ r@@ im@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the b@@ ell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."
O@@ k@@ a@@ y, so let@@ 's re@@ vie@@ w@@ :
a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, and a f@@ ar@@ m that m@@ ea@@ su@@ res its suc@@ c@@ ess on the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
A f@@ is@@ h f@@ ar@@ m, but also a bi@@ r@@ d s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ h, and by the wa@@ y, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os@@ , they sh@@ oul@@ dn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.
They b@@ ro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 mil@@ es a@@ wa@@ y, where the so@@ il con@@ d@@ iti@@ ons are better for buil@@ ding n@@ est@@ s.
E@@ very mor@@ n@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es into the f@@ ar@@ m.
And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es bac@@ k.
They do that because they're able to fol@@ low the b@@ ro@@ k@@ en wh@@ ite l@@ ine of hi@@ gh@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .
N@@ o ki@@ d@@ d@@ ing.
I was imagin@@ ing a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ in@@ s@@ " thing@@ , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ .
I said, "@@ M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es to the f@@ ar@@ m, and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mil@@ es back at ni@@ ght@@ ?
D@@ o they do that for the childre@@ n@@ ?"
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just qu@@ o@@ ted a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on son@@ g@@ .
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the fo@@ od@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved f@@ is@@ h, which was de@@ l@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don't like f@@ is@@ h sk@@ in@@ ;
I don't like it sea@@ re@@ d, I don't like it c@@ ri@@ sp@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, t@@ ar@@ -@@ like fl@@ av@@ or.
I al@@ most never co@@ ok with it.
Y@@ et, when I t@@ ast@@ ed it at that rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n S@@ p@@ ain@@ , it t@@ ast@@ ed not at all like f@@ is@@ h sk@@ in.
It t@@ ast@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and c@@ le@@ an, like you were ta@@ king a b@@ ite of the o@@ ce@@ an.
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.
He said, "@@ The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ ong@@ e.
It's the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se be@@ fore any@@ thing ent@@ ers the bo@@ d@@ y.
It evol@@ ved to so@@ a@@ k up im@@ p@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ But our wat@@ er has no im@@ p@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
O@@ K@@ . A f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its f@@ is@@ h,
a f@@ ar@@ m that m@@ ea@@ su@@ res its suc@@ c@@ ess by the suc@@ c@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
And then I realiz@@ ed when he sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ A f@@ ar@@ m that has no im@@ p@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big underst@@ at@@ em@@ ent, because the wat@@ er that f@@ low@@ s through that f@@ ar@@ m com@@ es in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qu@@ i@@ vi@@ r R@@ i@@ ver@@ .
It's a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s ten@@ d to car@@ r@@ y these da@@ ys@@ : ch@@ em@@ ical con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ant@@ s, p@@ est@@ ici@@ de r@@ un@@ off@@ .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the syst@@ em and lea@@ v@@ es, the wat@@ er is c@@ le@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ te@@ re@@ d.
The syst@@ em is so heal@@ th@@ y, it p@@ ur@@ i@@ fi@@ es the wat@@ er.
So, not just a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s, not just a f@@ ar@@ m that m@@ ea@@ su@@ res its suc@@ c@@ ess by the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, but a f@@ ar@@ m that's lit@@ er@@ ally a wat@@ er p@@ ur@@ i@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those f@@ is@@ h, but for you and me as w@@ ell@@ .
Because when that wat@@ er lea@@ v@@ es, it d@@ um@@ p@@ s out into the A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ ic.
A dro@@ p in the o@@ ce@@ an, I know, but I'@@ ll take it, and so should you@@ , because this lo@@ ve st@@ or@@ y, ho@@ we@@ ver r@@ om@@ ant@@ ic, is also in@@ struc@@ ti@@ ve.
You might say it's a re@@ ci@@ pe for the f@@ ut@@ ure of good fo@@ o@@ d, wh@@ e@@ ther we're tal@@ king about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f cat@@ t@@ l@@ e.
What we need now is a r@@ ad@@ ically new con@@ cep@@ tion of ag@@ r@@ icul@@ tu@@ re, one in which the fo@@ od actually t@@ ast@@ es go@@ o@@ d.
But for a lot peopl@@ e, that's a bit to@@ o r@@ ad@@ ic@@ al.
We@@ 're not real@@ ist@@ s, us fo@@ o@@ di@@ es@@ ;
we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We lo@@ ve f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s@@ ' mark@@ et@@ s,
we lo@@ ve sm@@ all famil@@ y f@@ ar@@ m@@ s,
we talk about loc@@ al fo@@ o@@ d,
we e@@ at organ@@ ic.
And when you su@@ gg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ sur@@ e the f@@ ut@@ ure of good fo@@ o@@ d, some@@ on@@ e, some@@ where st@@ an@@ ds up and sa@@ y@@ s, "@@ H@@ ey gu@@ y, I lo@@ ve p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os@@ , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?"
How are you going to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est@@ ?
I don't lo@@ ve that quest@@ ion@@ .
No@@ , not because we al@@ read@@ y produc@@ e en@@ ough cal@@ ori@@ es to more than fe@@ ed the worl@@ d.
O@@ ne bil@@ lion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y to@@ da@@ y.
O@@ ne bil@@ lion -- that's more than ever be@@ fore -- because of gr@@ os@@ s in@@ e@@ qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion@@ , not t@@ on@@ n@@ ag@@ e.
Now, I don't lo@@ ve this quest@@ ion because it's de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our fo@@ od syst@@ em for the last 50 year@@ s.
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to h@@ er@@ bi@@ vo@@ re@@ s, p@@ est@@ ici@@ de@@ s to mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s, ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il@@ , ch@@ ick@@ en to f@@ is@@ h, and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ in@@ ess has simpl@@ y as@@ ke@@ d, "@@ If we're fe@@ e@@ ding more people more ch@@ ea@@ pl@@ y, how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"
That's been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation,
it's been the j@@ ust@@ i@@ fic@@ ation@@ :
it's been the bus@@ in@@ ess pl@@ an of Americ@@ an ag@@ r@@ icul@@ tu@@ re.
We should c@@ all it what it is@@ : a bus@@ in@@ ess in li@@ qu@@ i@@ d@@ ation, a bus@@ in@@ ess that's qu@@ ick@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ olog@@ ical cap@@ it@@ al that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ bl@@ e.
That's not a bus@@ in@@ es@@ s, and it is@@ n't ag@@ r@@ icul@@ tu@@ re.
O@@ ur b@@ read@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed to@@ day, not because of d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ing sup@@ pl@@ y, but because of d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h@@ ing res@@ our@@ c@@ es. No@@ t by the lat@@ est com@@ bine and tr@@ act@@ or in@@ ven@@ tion@@ , but by fer@@ t@@ ile l@@ and@@ ; not by p@@ um@@ p@@ s, but by f@@ res@@ h wat@@ er@@ ; not by c@@ ha@@ in@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by fo@@ rest@@ s@@ ; and not by f@@ is@@ h@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and n@@ et@@ s, but by f@@ is@@ h in the sea@@ .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the worl@@ d@@ ?
L@@ et@@ 's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
O@@ r bet@@ ter@@ : How can we cre@@ ate con@@ d@@ iti@@ ons that en@@ able every commun@@ ity to fe@@ ed it@@ self@@ ?
T@@ o do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ in@@ ess mode@@ l for the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
It's really ol@@ d, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.
It's hi@@ gh on cap@@ it@@ al, ch@@ em@@ i@@ str@@ y and m@@ ach@@ in@@ es, and it's never pro@@ du@@ ce@@ d any@@ thing really good to e@@ at.
In@@ st@@ ea@@ d, let@@ 's look to the ec@@ olog@@ ical mode@@ l@@ .
That's the one that re@@ li@@ es on two bil@@ lion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ jo@@ b experien@@ ce.
L@@ oo@@ k to M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ , f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s like M@@ i@@ gu@@ el@@ . F@@ ar@@ m@@ s that are@@ n't worl@@ ds un@@ to the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ s that rest@@ ore inst@@ ea@@ d of de@@ pl@@ e@@ te@@ ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ s that f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely inst@@ ea@@ d of just in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y@@ ; f@@ ar@@ mer@@ s that are not just produc@@ er@@ s, but exper@@ ts in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p@@ s. Because they're the on@@ es that are exper@@ ts in fl@@ av@@ or, to@@ o.
And if I'm going to be really h@@ on@@ est@@ , they're a better ch@@ e@@ f than I'@@ ll ever b@@ e.
You know, I'm o@@ k@@ a@@ y with that, because if that's the f@@ ut@@ ure of good fo@@ o@@ d, it's going to be de@@ l@@ ici@@ ou@@ s.
Thank you.
I gre@@ w up on a st@@ ea@@ dy di@@ et of scien@@ ce fic@@ tion.
In hi@@ gh sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , I to@@ ok a bu@@ s to sch@@ oo@@ l an h@@ our each way every da@@ y.
And I was al@@ ways ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ed in a bo@@ o@@ k, scien@@ ce fic@@ tion bo@@ o@@ k, which to@@ ok my min@@ d to other worl@@ ds, and s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed, in a n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative form@@ , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sen@@ se of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity that I ha@@ d.
And you know, that cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity also man@@ i@@ f@@ est@@ ed it@@ sel@@ f in the fac@@ t that wh@@ en@@ ever I was@@ n't in sch@@ oo@@ l I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds, hi@@ king and ta@@ king "@@ s@@ am@@ pl@@ es@@ " -- f@@ ro@@ g@@ s and s@@ n@@ a@@ kes and bu@@ g@@ s and p@@ ond wat@@ er -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it bac@@ k, looking at it un@@ der the mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ e.
You know, I was a real scien@@ ce ge@@ e@@ k.
But it was all about trying to underst@@ and the worl@@ d, underst@@ and the l@@ im@@ its of possi@@ bil@@ ity.
And my lo@@ ve of scien@@ ce fic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed mi@@ r@@ ro@@ red in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were expl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ an@@ s.
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ st@@ eau was com@@ ing into our li@@ ving ro@@ om@@ s with his a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing speci@@ als that sho@@ w@@ ed us anim@@ als and plac@@ es and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly imagin@@ ed.
So, that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the wh@@ ole scien@@ ce fic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an ar@@ ti@@ st@@ .
I could d@@ ra@@ w. I could p@@ ain@@ t.
And I found that because there w@@ ere@@ n't vide@@ o g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the medi@@ a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, I had to cre@@ ate these imag@@ es in my hea@@ d.
You know, we all di@@ d, as ki@@ ds ha@@ ving to re@@ ad a bo@@ o@@ k, and through the au@@ th@@ or@@ 's de@@ scri@@ p@@ tion@@ , put something on the mo@@ v@@ ie sc@@ re@@ en in our hea@@ d@@ s.
And so@@ , my respon@@ se to this was to p@@ ain@@ t, to d@@ ra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ s, ali@@ en worl@@ ds, robo@@ t@@ s, sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ s, all that stu@@ ff@@ .
I was en@@ d@@ l@@ ess@@ ly get@@ ting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h clas@@ s do@@ od@@ l@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind the tex@@ t@@ bo@@ o@@ k.
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity had to find its out@@ le@@ t some@@ ho@@ w.
And an interest@@ ing thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ st@@ eau sho@@ ws actually got me very ex@@ cit@@ ed about the fac@@ t that there was an ali@@ en world right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day --
that se@@ em@@ ed pret@@ ty d@@ ar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
But that was a world I could really go to@@ , right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ o@@ tic as any@@ thing that I had imagin@@ ed from read@@ ing these bo@@ o@@ k@@ s.
So, I deci@@ ded I was going to bec@@ ome a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .
And the only prob@@ le@@ m with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ ill@@ age in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a, 6@@ 00 mil@@ es from the n@@ ea@@ res@@ t o@@ ce@@ an.
But I didn't le@@ t that da@@ un@@ t m@@ e.
I p@@ est@@ ere@@ d my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally found a sc@@ ub@@ a clas@@ s in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k, right ac@@ ros@@ s the bor@@ der from where we li@@ ve.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of w@@ in@@ ter in B@@ u@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Y@@ or@@ k.
And I didn't see the o@@ ce@@ an, a real o@@ ce@@ an, for another two year@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we mo@@ ved to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
S@@ in@@ ce th@@ en, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 year@@ s, I've sp@@ ent about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ wat@@ er, and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.
And I've lear@@ ned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oc@@ ean en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ , and even the sh@@ al@@ low o@@ ce@@ an@@ s, are so r@@ ich with a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing life that really is be@@ y@@ ond our imagin@@ ation.
N@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ 's imagin@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ less comp@@ are@@ d to our own m@@ ea@@ g@@ er human imagin@@ ation.
I st@@ ill@@ , to this day, st@@ and in ab@@ solu@@ te a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ v@@ es.
And my lo@@ ve a@@ ff@@ a@@ ir with the oc@@ ean is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as str@@ ong as it ever was@@ .
But when I ch@@ ose a care@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the b@@ est way to re@@ con@@ c@@ ile this ur@@ ge I had to tell st@@ ori@@ es with my ur@@ g@@ es to cre@@ ate imag@@ es.
And I was@@ , as a ki@@ d, con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing com@@ ic bo@@ o@@ k@@ s, and so on.
So, fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king was the way to put pic@@ tu@@ res and st@@ ori@@ es toge@@ th@@ er, and that made sen@@ s@@ e.
And of cour@@ se the st@@ ori@@ es that I ch@@ ose to tell were scien@@ ce fic@@ tion st@@ ori@@ es@@ : "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or@@ ," "@@ A@@ li@@ en@@ s@@ " and "@@ The A@@ b@@ ys@@ s@@ ."
And with "@@ The A@@ b@@ ys@@ s@@ ," I was put@@ ting toge@@ ther my lo@@ ve of under@@ wat@@ er and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ing.
So, you know, mer@@ g@@ ing the two pas@@ sion@@ s.
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing interest@@ ing came out of "@@ The A@@ b@@ ys@@ s@@ ," which was that to sol@@ ve a speci@@ fi@@ c n@@ ar@@ r@@ ative prob@@ le@@ m on that fil@@ m, which was to cre@@ ate this kind of li@@ qu@@ id wat@@ er cre@@ at@@ u@@ re, we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed com@@ pute@@ r gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first so@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ sur@@ face that was ever in a mo@@ vi@@ e.
And even th@@ ough the fil@@ m didn't make any mon@@ ey -- b@@ are@@ ly b@@ ro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing, which is that the au@@ di@@ en@@ ce, the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ en@@ ce, was m@@ es@@ mer@@ iz@@ ed by this ap@@ p@@ aren@@ t mag@@ ic.
You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke@@ 's la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent@@ ly ad@@ v@@ an@@ ce@@ d technolog@@ y is indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from mag@@ ic.
They were se@@ e@@ ing something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very ex@@ cit@@ ed.
And I thou@@ ght, "@@ W@@ o@@ w, this is something that ne@@ e@@ ds to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ ati@@ c ar@@ t@@ ."
So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m, we to@@ ok that much f@@ ar@@ th@@ er.
W@@ or@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qu@@ id m@@ et@@ al du@@ de in that fil@@ m. The suc@@ c@@ ess h@@ un@@ g in the b@@ al@@ ance on wh@@ e@@ ther that eff@@ ect would wor@@ k.
And it di@@ d, and we cre@@ ated ma@@ gi@@ c again@@ ,
and we had the same res@@ ul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ en@@ ce --
al@@ th@@ ough we did make a little more mon@@ ey on that on@@ e.
So, d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing a l@@ ine through those two do@@ ts of experien@@ ce came to@@ , "@@ This is going to be a wh@@ ole new worl@@ d@@ ," this was a wh@@ ole new world of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity for fil@@ m ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s.
So, I started a comp@@ any with S@@ t@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, my good fri@@ end S@@ t@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ atur@@ e desig@@ ne@@ r at that tim@@ e, and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al D@@ om@@ ain@@ .
And the con@@ cep@@ t of the comp@@ any was that we would lea@@ p@@ f@@ ro@@ g p@@ ast the an@@ al@@ o@@ g proces@@ s@@ es of op@@ tic@@ al pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to di@@ g@@ it@@ al produc@@ tion.
And we actually did that and it ga@@ ve us a comp@@ et@@ iti@@ ve ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ ile.
But we found our@@ sel@@ ves l@@ ag@@ g@@ ing in the mi@@ d '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ atur@@ e and ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter desig@@ n stu@@ f@@ f that we had actually fo@@ un@@ ded the comp@@ any to do@@ .
So, I w@@ ro@@ te this pi@@ ec@@ e called "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ o@@ pe of vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect@@ s, of C@@ G eff@@ ect@@ s, be@@ y@@ on@@ d, with real@@ ist@@ ic human emo@@ tive ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ ,
and the ma@@ in ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s would all be in C@@ G@@ ,
and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ vel@@ o@@ pe p@@ us@@ h@@ ed bac@@ k,
and I was t@@ old by the fol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we w@@ ere@@ n't going to be able to do this for a wh@@ ile.
So, I sh@@ el@@ ved it, and I made this other mo@@ v@@ ie about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ k@@ s.
You know, I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the studi@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ om@@ e@@ o and J@@ ul@@ i@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ :
"@@ It's going to be this e@@ pi@@ c r@@ om@@ an@@ ce, pas@@ sion@@ ate fil@@ m@@ ."
S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ly, what I wan@@ ted to do was I wan@@ ted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And that's the tr@@ u@@ th@@ . Now, the studi@@ o didn't know that.
But I con@@ vin@@ ce@@ d them. I said, "@@ We@@ 're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k. We@@ 're going to fil@@ m it for re@@ al.
We@@ 'll be using it in the o@@ pen@@ ing of the fil@@ m.
It will be really importan@@ t. It will be a great mark@@ et@@ ing ho@@ o@@ k@@ ."
And I tal@@ ked them into f@@ un@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ on.
S@@ oun@@ ds c@@ ra@@ z@@ y. But this go@@ es back to that the@@ me about your imagin@@ ation cre@@ ating a real@@ ity.
Because we actually cre@@ ated a real@@ ity where si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s lat@@ er, I find m@@ y@@ sel@@ f in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a hal@@ f mil@@ es down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ l@@ ant@@ ic, looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a vie@@ w por@@ t. No@@ t a mo@@ vi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for re@@ al.
Now, that b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d.
And it to@@ ok a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation, we had to buil@@ d cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all k@@ in@@ ds of thing@@ s. B@@ ut@@ , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve, these de@@ ep di@@ v@@ es, was like a sp@@ ace mis@@ si@@ on.
You know, where it was hi@@ gh@@ ly techn@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qu@@ i@@ red en@@ or@@ m@@ ous plan@@ n@@ ing.
You get in this cap@@ s@@ ul@@ e, you go down to this d@@ ar@@ k ho@@ st@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment where there is no ho@@ pe of re@@ sc@@ ue if you can't get back by you@@ r@@ self@@ .
And I thought lik@@ e, "@@ W@@ o@@ w. I'm lik@@ e, li@@ ving in a scien@@ ce fic@@ tion mo@@ vi@@ e.
This is really co@@ ol@@ ."
And so@@ , I really got b@@ it@@ ten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oc@@ ean expl@@ or@@ ation.
O@@ f cour@@ se, the cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity, the scien@@ ce comp@@ on@@ ent of it --
it was every@@ thing@@ . It was ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ re, it was cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity, it was imagin@@ ation.
And it was an experien@@ ce that H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ o@@ od c@@ oul@@ dn't give m@@ e.
Bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, you know, I could imag@@ ine a cre@@ atur@@ e and we could cre@@ ate a vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect for it. But I c@@ oul@@ dn't imag@@ ine what I was se@@ e@@ ing out that w@@ in@@ do@@ w.
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ s, I was se@@ e@@ ing cre@@ at@@ u@@ res at h@@ y@@ dro@@ th@@ er@@ ma@@ l v@@ ents and som@@ et@@ im@@ es things that I had never se@@ en be@@ fo@@ re, som@@ et@@ im@@ es things that no one had se@@ en be@@ fo@@ re, that actually were not de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed by scien@@ ce at the time that we sa@@ w them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was compl@@ et@@ ely sm@@ it@@ ten by this, and had to do mo@@ re.
And so@@ , I actually made a kind of cur@@ i@@ ous dec@@ is@@ ion@@ .
A@@ f@@ ter the suc@@ c@@ ess of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "@@ O@@ K@@ , I'm going to par@@ k my day jo@@ b as a H@@ ol@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ o@@ od mo@@ v@@ ie ma@@ k@@ er, and I'm going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time expl@@ o@@ re@@ r for a wh@@ il@@ e@@ ."
And so@@ , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ s.
And we w@@ o@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and expl@@ or@@ ing it with robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k.
We to@@ ok little bo@@ ts that we had cre@@ ated that sp@@ o@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that shi@@ p@@ , which had never been don@@ e.
No@@ body had ever loo@@ ked in@@ side the w@@ rec@@ k. They didn't have the me@@ ans to do it, so we cre@@ ated technolog@@ y to do it.
So, you know, here I am no@@ w, on the dec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic, sit@@ ting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ e, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pla@@ y@@ ed.
And I'm fl@@ ying a little robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p@@ .
When I say, "@@ I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my min@@ d is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ e.
I fel@@ t like I was ph@@ ys@@ ically pres@@ ent in@@ side the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic.
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experien@@ ce I've ever ha@@ d, because I would know be@@ fore I tur@@ ned a cor@@ ne@@ r what was going to be there be@@ fore the li@@ gh@@ ts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had w@@ al@@ ked the se@@ t for mon@@ th@@ s when we were ma@@ king the mo@@ vi@@ e.
And the se@@ t was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ act re@@ pl@@ ica on the bl@@ u@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the shi@@ p@@ .
So, it was this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely re@@ mark@@ able experien@@ ce.
And it really made me realiz@@ e that the tel@@ e@@ pre@@ sen@@ ce experien@@ ce -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your con@@ sc@@ i@@ ous@@ n@@ ess is in@@ j@@ ec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ e, into this other for@@ m of exist@@ en@@ ce.
It was re@@ ally, really qu@@ ite pro@@ fo@@ un@@ d.
And it may be a little bit of a gl@@ im@@ p@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some dec@@ a@@ de@@ s out as we start to have c@@ y@@ bor@@ g bo@@ di@@ es for expl@@ or@@ ation or for other me@@ ans in many sort of po@@ st@@ -@@ human f@@ ut@@ u@@ res that I can imagin@@ e, as a scien@@ ce fic@@ tion f@@ an.
So, ha@@ ving d@@ one these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ s, and really be@@ gin@@ ning to ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate what was down the@@ re, s@@ uch as at the de@@ ep oc@@ ean v@@ ents where we had these a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing, a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing anim@@ als --
they're bas@@ ically al@@ ien@@ s right here on E@@ ar@@ th@@ .
They li@@ ve in an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is. They don't sur@@ vi@@ ve on sun@@ li@@ ght@@ -@@ bas@@ ed syst@@ em the way we do@@ .
And so@@ , you're se@@ e@@ ing anim@@ als that are li@@ ving next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de wat@@ er pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possi@@ b@@ ly exist@@ .
A@@ t the same time I was get@@ ting very interest@@ ed in sp@@ ace scien@@ ce as w@@ ell -- again@@ , it's the scien@@ ce fic@@ tion inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ce, as a ki@@ d.
And I w@@ o@@ und up get@@ ting in@@ vol@@ ved with the sp@@ ace commun@@ ity, really in@@ vol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ , sit@@ ting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vis@@ ory bo@@ ar@@ d, plan@@ ning actu@@ al sp@@ ace mis@@ sion@@ s, going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ c@@ os@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ e@@ dic@@ al pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, and all these sor@@ ts of thing@@ s, to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ation@@ al sp@@ ace st@@ ation with our 3@@ D cam@@ era system@@ s.
And this was f@@ as@@ cin@@ at@@ ing.
But what I w@@ o@@ und up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing sp@@ ace scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s with us into the de@@ ep@@ .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had ac@@ c@@ ess -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ olog@@ ist@@ s, plan@@ et@@ ary scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s, people who were interest@@ ed in these ex@@ tre@@ me en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ s -- ta@@ king them down to the v@@ ent@@ s, and let@@ ting them se@@ e, and take s@@ am@@ pl@@ es and te@@ st in@@ str@@ um@@ ent@@ s, and so on.
So, here we were ma@@ king do@@ cum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s, but actually doing scien@@ ce, and actually doing sp@@ ace scien@@ ce.
I'@@ d compl@@ et@@ ely cl@@ os@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the scien@@ ce fic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stu@@ f@@ f for re@@ al. And you know, al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of di@@ sco@@ ver@@ y, I lear@@ ned a lo@@ t.
I lear@@ ned a lot about scien@@ ce. But I also lear@@ ned a lot about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p@@ .
Now you think direc@@ t@@ or has got to be a lea@@ der@@ , lea@@ der of@@ , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p@@ , and all that sort of thing@@ .
I didn't really lear@@ n about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ s.
Because I had to@@ , at a cer@@ ta@@ in poin@@ t, say, "@@ What am I doing out here@@ ?
Wh@@ y am I doing th@@ is@@ ? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make mon@@ ey at these d@@ am@@ n sho@@ w@@ s.
We b@@ are@@ ly bre@@ a@@ k ev@@ en@@ . There is no f@@ ame in it.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple sort of think I went a@@ way between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ a@@ il@@ s some@@ plac@@ e, sit@@ ting at the be@@ ach@@ .
M@@ a@@ de all these fil@@ m@@ s, made all these do@@ cum@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s for a very l@@ imit@@ ed au@@ di@@ en@@ ce.
N@@ o fam@@ e, no gl@@ or@@ y, no mon@@ e@@ y. What are you do@@ ing@@ ?
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing it for the t@@ as@@ k it@@ self@@ , for the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge -- and the oc@@ ean is the most ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment there is -- for the thr@@ ill of di@@ sco@@ ver@@ y, and for that str@@ ang@@ e b@@ ond that happen@@ s when a sm@@ all gr@@ ou@@ p of people for@@ m a ti@@ ght@@ ly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am@@ .
Because we would do these things with 1@@ 0@@ , 1@@ 2 peopl@@ e, wor@@ king for years at a tim@@ e,
som@@ et@@ im@@ es at s@@ ea for tw@@ o, three mon@@ th@@ s at a tim@@ e.
And in that b@@ on@@ d, you realiz@@ e that the most important thing is the re@@ spec@@ t that you have for them and that they have for you@@ , that you@@ 've d@@ one a t@@ as@@ k that you can't expl@@ a@@ in to some@@ one el@@ s@@ e.
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic@@ , and the at@@ t@@ ent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technolog@@ y of it, and the diff@@ icul@@ t@@ y, the h@@ uman@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as@@ p@@ ect@@ s of wor@@ king at sea@@ ," you can't expl@@ a@@ in it to peopl@@ e. It's that thing that ma@@ ybe cop@@ s ha@@ ve, or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something toge@@ ther and they know they can never expl@@ a@@ in it.
C@@ re@@ at@@ es a b@@ on@@ d, cre@@ at@@ es a b@@ ond of re@@ spec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next mo@@ vi@@ e, which was "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tri@@ ed to ap@@ pl@@ y that same prin@@ ci@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p@@ , which is that you re@@ spec@@ t your te@@ am@@ , and you ear@@ n their re@@ spec@@ t in re@@ tur@@ n@@ .
And it really chang@@ ed the d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic.
So, here I was ag@@ a@@ in with a sm@@ all te@@ am@@ , in un@@ ch@@ ar@@ ted ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y, doing "@@ A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," com@@ ing up with new technolog@@ y that didn't ex@@ ist be@@ fo@@ re.
Tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly ex@@ cit@@ ing.
Tre@@ men@@ dou@@ s@@ ly ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing.
And we bec@@ ame a famil@@ y, over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f y@@ ear per@@ io@@ d.
And it compl@@ et@@ ely chang@@ ed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es.
So, people have com@@ men@@ ted on ho@@ w, "@@ Well, you know, you br@@ ou@@ ght back the oc@@ ean organ@@ is@@ m@@ s and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ."
T@@ o me, it was more of a fund@@ ament@@ al way of doing bus@@ in@@ es@@ s, the pro@@ c@@ ess it@@ self@@ , that chang@@ ed as a res@@ ul@@ t of that.
So, what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ e out of all th@@ is@@ ?
You know, what are the l@@ es@@ son@@ s lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ?
Well, I think num@@ ber one is cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity.
It's the most pow@@ er@@ ful thing you o@@ wn@@ .
I@@ ma@@ gin@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ i@@ f@@ est a real@@ ity.
And the re@@ spec@@ t of your te@@ am is more important than all the l@@ au@@ rel@@ s in the worl@@ d.
I have y@@ oun@@ g fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ v@@ ice for doing th@@ is@@ ."
And I say, "@@ D@@ on@@ 't put l@@ imit@@ ations on you@@ r@@ self@@ .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to you@@ r@@ self@@ , don't be@@ t again@@ st you@@ r@@ self@@ ,
and take ris@@ k@@ s@@ ."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they li@@ ke@@ : "@@ F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in ar@@ t and in expl@@ or@@ ation, because it's a lea@@ p of fa@@ i@@ th@@ .
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in@@ no@@ v@@ ation was d@@ one with@@ out ris@@ k.
You have to be w@@ ill@@ ing to take those ris@@ k@@ s.
So, that's the thought I would lea@@ ve you with@@ , is that in wh@@ ate@@ ver you're do@@ ing, fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion@@ , but f@@ ear is no@@ t. Thank you.
If I can lea@@ ve you with one big idea to@@ day, it's that the wh@@ ole of the data in which we con@@ sum@@ e is gre@@ at@@ er that the su@@ m of the part@@ s, and inst@@ ea@@ d of thin@@ king about inform@@ ation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ ad@@ , what I'@@ d like you to think about is how we can use inform@@ ation so that pat@@ tern@@ s po@@ p and we can see tre@@ n@@ ds that would oth@@ er@@ w@@ ise be in@@ vis@@ i@@ bl@@ e.
So what we're looking at right here is a t@@ y@@ p@@ ical mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ ar@@ t organiz@@ ed by ag@@ e.
This to@@ ol that I'm using here is a little exper@@ iment@@ . It's called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can ch@@ o@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one partic@@ ul@@ ar c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ s -- say, ac@@ ci@@ dent@@ s.
An@@ d, right a@@ wa@@ y, I see there's a different pat@@ ter@@ n that em@@ er@@ g@@ es.
This is bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, in the mi@@ d@@ -@@ area here@@ , people are at their most activ@@ e, and over here they're at their most f@@ ra@@ il@@ .
We can st@@ ep back out ag@@ a@@ in and then re@@ organiz@@ e the data by c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ th@@ , se@@ e@@ ing that ci@@ r@@ cul@@ at@@ ory di@@ sea@@ s@@ es and can@@ ce@@ r are the us@@ u@@ al s@@ us@@ p@@ ect@@ s, but not for every@@ on@@ e.
If we go a@@ hea@@ d and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ dent@@ s are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed ab@@ ou@@ t.
And if you dr@@ ill into that, it's es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally the c@@ ase for men@@ .
So you get the idea that vie@@ w@@ ing inform@@ ation, vie@@ w@@ ing data in this wa@@ y, is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing in a li@@ ving inform@@ ation in@@ fo@@ -@@ grap@@ h@@ ic.
And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for con@@ t@@ ent as w@@ ell@@ ?
So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every sing@@ le S@@ port@@ s I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever pro@@ du@@ ce@@ d.
It's all here@@ ; it's all on the we@@ b@@ .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
W@@ it@@ h P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, you can dr@@ ill into a dec@@ a@@ de.
You can dr@@ ill into a partic@@ ul@@ ar year@@ .
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a speci@@ fi@@ c is@@ su@@ e.
So I'm looking at th@@ is@@ ; I see the a@@ th@@ le@@ te@@ s that have ap@@ p@@ ea@@ red in this is@@ su@@ e, the sp@@ or@@ t@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an, so I'@@ ll go a@@ hea@@ d and I'@@ ll cl@@ ic@@ k on that, which re@@ ve@@ al@@ s, for me, all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong@@ 's been a part of@@ .
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at th@@ es@@ e, I might thin@@ k, "@@ Well, what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can st@@ ep bac@@ k, and ex@@ p@@ and on that.
And I see G@@ re@@ g L@@ e@@ M@@ ond no@@ w.
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate over inform@@ ation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w@@ er, b@@ ro@@ ad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not sear@@ ch@@ ing, you're not b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing.
Y@@ ou@@ 're doing something that's actually a little bit differen@@ t.
It's in betwe@@ en, and we think it chang@@ es the way inform@@ ation can be us@@ ed.
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit c@@ ra@@ z@@ y.
What we're d@@ one here is we've ta@@ k@@ en every sing@@ le W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age and we re@@ du@@ ce@@ d it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y.
So the sum@@ mar@@ y con@@ sist@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the to@@ p@@ ical area that it com@@ es fr@@ om@@ .
I'm only sho@@ w@@ ing the to@@ p 5@@ 00 most popul@@ ar W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ag@@ es right here@@ .
But even in this l@@ imit@@ ed vie@@ w, we can do a lot of thing@@ s.
R@@ i@@ ght a@@ wa@@ y, we get a sen@@ se of what are the to@@ p@@ ical dom@@ ain@@ s that are most popul@@ ar on W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a.
I'm going to go a@@ hea@@ d and sel@@ ect go@@ vern@@ ment@@ .
Now, ha@@ ving sel@@ ec@@ ted go@@ vern@@ ment@@ , I can now see that the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a cat@@ eg@@ ori@@ es that most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly cor@@ resp@@ ond to that are T@@ ime mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ e@@ o@@ ple of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with@@ in any one W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ag@@ e.
It's only possi@@ ble to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you st@@ ep back and look at all of them.
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these partic@@ ul@@ ar sum@@ mar@@ i@@ es, I can then dr@@ ill into the con@@ cep@@ t of T@@ ime mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ er@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them.
So looking at these peopl@@ e, I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from go@@ vern@@ ment@@ ;
some have come from natur@@ al scien@@ ces@@ ;
som@@ e, fe@@ w@@ er st@@ ill@@ , have come from bus@@ in@@ ess --
there's my b@@ os@@ s --
and one has come from mus@@ ic.
And interest@@ ing@@ ly en@@ ou@@ gh@@ , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ in@@ n@@ er.
So we can go@@ , j@@ um@@ p@@ , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ in@@ ner@@ s.
So you se@@ e, we're n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a we@@ b@@ , not from p@@ ag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ p@@ ag@@ e, but at a hi@@ gh@@ er le@@ ve@@ l of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e.
I'm just sho@@ w@@ ing the New Y@@ or@@ k T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ s@@ ite here@@ .
So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, this ap@@ plic@@ ation -- I don't want to c@@ all it a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a b@@ ro@@ w@@ ser@@ , but you can vie@@ w we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technolog@@ y to every sing@@ le we@@ b p@@ age like this.
So I can st@@ ep bac@@ k, po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fi@@ c sec@@ tion.
Now the reas@@ on why this is important is bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ w@@ ing we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es in this wa@@ y, I can look at my enti@@ re b@@ ro@@ w@@ s@@ ing h@@ ist@@ ory in the ex@@ act same wa@@ y.
So I can dr@@ ill into what I've d@@ one over speci@@ fi@@ c time fr@@ am@@ es.
H@@ ere@@ , in fac@@ t, is the st@@ ate of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just g@@ ave@@ .
And I can sort of re@@ pla@@ y some stu@@ f@@ f that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er to@@ da@@ y.
An@@ d, if I want to st@@ ep back and look at every@@ thing@@ , I can s@@ l@@ ice and d@@ ice my h@@ ist@@ or@@ y, per@@ hap@@ s by my sear@@ ch h@@ ist@@ ory --
here@@ , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ st@@ ic sear@@ ch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for L@@ i@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t.
And from th@@ es@@ e, I can dr@@ ill into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ unc@@ h them again@@ .
It's one m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed mul@@ ti@@ ple tim@@ es, and in each c@@ ase it ma@@ kes the wh@@ ole gre@@ at@@ er than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts with the dat@@ a.
So right no@@ w, in this worl@@ d, we think about data as being this cur@@ s@@ e.
We talk about the cur@@ se of inform@@ ation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ ad@@ .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in dat@@ a.
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ side down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ side do@@ wn@@ , so that inst@@ ea@@ d of n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many thing@@ s, and then being able to see the pat@@ tern@@ s that were oth@@ er@@ w@@ ise hi@@ d@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then inst@@ ea@@ d of being tr@@ ap@@ p@@ ed in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act inform@@ ation.
An@@ d, inst@@ ea@@ d of de@@ al@@ ing just with inform@@ ation, we can te@@ ase out kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ e.
And if we get the kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ e, then ma@@ ybe even there's w@@ is@@ do@@ m to be fo@@ un@@ d.
So with that, I th@@ ank you.
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ in@@ ess these da@@ y@@ s.
I had some@@ body coun@@ t the num@@ ber of bo@@ o@@ ks with "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " in the tit@@ le publi@@ sh@@ ed in the last fi@@ ve years and they ga@@ ve up after about 4@@ 0@@ , and there were many mo@@ re.
There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of interes@@ t in happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, am@@ ong re@@ sear@@ ch@@ er@@ s.
There is a lot of happ@@ in@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing.
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er.
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of wor@@ k, there are se@@ ver@@ al co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ possi@@ ble to think str@@ ai@@ ght about happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
And my talk to@@ day will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ s.
This ap@@ pl@@ i@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thin@@ king about their own happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, and it ap@@ pl@@ i@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thin@@ king about happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, because it tur@@ n@@ s out we're just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is.
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ m@@ it compl@@ ex@@ ity.
It tur@@ n@@ s out that the wor@@ d "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ ef@@ ul wor@@ d any@@ mo@@ re, because we ap@@ pl@@ y it to to@@ o many different thing@@ s.
I think there is one partic@@ ul@@ ar me@@ an@@ ing to which we might re@@ str@@ ic@@ t it, but by and lar@@ g@@ e, this is something that we@@ 'll have to give up and we@@ 'll have to a@@ do@@ p@@ t the more compl@@ ic@@ ated vie@@ w of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is.
The sec@@ ond tra@@ p is a con@@ f@@ us@@ ion between experien@@ ce and mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being happ@@ y in your lif@@ e, and being happ@@ y about your life or happ@@ y with your lif@@ e.
And those are two very different con@@ ce@@ pt@@ s, and they're bo@@ th lum@@ p@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the fo@@ c@@ using ill@@ us@@ ion@@ , and it's the un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate fac@@ t that we can't think about any ci@@ r@@ cum@@ st@@ ance that a@@ ff@@ ect@@ s w@@ ell@@ -@@ being with@@ out dist@@ or@@ ting its importan@@ ce.
I me@@ an, this is a real co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ ve tr@@ ap@@ .
Th@@ ere's just no way of get@@ ting it ri@@ gh@@ t.
Now, I'@@ d like to start with an exam@@ ple of some@@ body who had a quest@@ ion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ w@@ er s@@ es@@ sion after one of my l@@ ec@@ tu@@ res re@@ por@@ ted a st@@ or@@ y, and that was a st@@ ory --
He sai@@ d he@@ '@@ d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y, and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic
and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ d@@ ing, there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful sc@@ re@@ ec@@ h@@ ing so@@ un@@ d. And then he ad@@ de@@ d, really qu@@ ite emo@@ tion@@ ally, it r@@ u@@ in@@ ed the wh@@ ole experien@@ ce.
But it ha@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t. What it had r@@ u@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ ori@@ es of the experien@@ ce.
He had had the experien@@ ce.
He had had 20 minu@@ te@@ s of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic.
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was le@@ f@@ t with a mem@@ or@@ y@@ ;
the mem@@ ory was r@@ u@@ in@@ ed, and the mem@@ ory was all that he had go@@ t@@ ten to ke@@ ep@@ .
What this is tel@@ l@@ ing us, re@@ ally, is that we might be thin@@ king of our@@ sel@@ ves and of other people in ter@@ m@@ s of two sel@@ v@@ es.
There is an experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ , who li@@ ves in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent, is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the p@@ ast@@ , but bas@@ ically it has only the pres@@ ent.
It's the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es --
you know, when the do@@ c@@ t@@ or as@@ k@@ s, "@@ D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you here@@ ?"
And then there is a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sco@@ re, and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ s the st@@ ory of our lif@@ e,
and it's the one that the do@@ c@@ t@@ or ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the quest@@ ion@@ , "@@ How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"
or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.
Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ iti@@ es, the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and get@@ ting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
Now, the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f is a st@@ or@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er.
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic respon@@ se of our mem@@ ori@@ es -- it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.
We don't only tell st@@ ori@@ es when we se@@ t out to tell st@@ ori@@ es.
O@@ ur mem@@ ory tel@@ l@@ s us st@@ ori@@ es, that is, what we get to ke@@ ep from our experien@@ ces is a st@@ or@@ y.
And le@@ t me be@@ g@@ in with one exam@@ pl@@ e.
This is an old stu@@ d@@ y. Th@@ ose are actu@@ al p@@ ati@@ ents under@@ going a p@@ ain@@ ful pro@@ ce@@ du@@ re.
I won@@ 't go into de@@ ta@@ il@@ . It's no l@@ ong@@ er p@@ ain@@ ful these da@@ y@@ s, but it was p@@ ain@@ ful when this stu@@ dy was r@@ un in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s.
They were as@@ ked to re@@ por@@ t on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 sec@@ on@@ d@@ s.
H@@ ere are two p@@ ati@@ ent@@ s, those are their rec@@ or@@ d@@ ing@@ s.
And you are as@@ ke@@ d, "@@ Wh@@ o of them su@@ ff@@ ere@@ d mo@@ re@@ ?"
And it's a very eas@@ y quest@@ ion@@ .
C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ ere@@ d more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was l@@ ong@@ er, and every minu@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A ha@@ d, P@@ ati@@ ent B ha@@ d, and mo@@ re.
But now there is another quest@@ ion@@ : "@@ How much did these p@@ ati@@ ents think they su@@ ff@@ ere@@ d@@ ?"
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e. The sur@@ pr@@ ise is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The st@@ ori@@ es of the col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es were differen@@ t, and because a very cr@@ it@@ ical part of the st@@ ory is how it en@@ d@@ s.
And ne@@ i@@ ther of these st@@ ori@@ es is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ in@@ c@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ in@@ c@@ t@@ ly wor@@ se than the oth@@ er.
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its p@@ ea@@ k at the very en@@ d@@ ;
it's a b@@ ad st@@ or@@ y.
How do we know that@@ ?
Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y, and much lat@@ er, to@@ o, "@@ How b@@ ad was the wh@@ ole thing@@ , in to@@ tal@@ ?"
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B@@ , in mem@@ or@@ y.
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ rom the poin@@ t of vie@@ w of the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ , c@@ lear@@ ly, B had a wor@@ se tim@@ e.
Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A@@ , and we actually r@@ an cl@@ in@@ ical exper@@ iment@@ s, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ ten@@ d the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it to@@ o mu@@ ch@@ .
That will c@@ ause the p@@ ati@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er, but just a little and much less than be@@ fo@@ re.
And if you do that for a c@@ ou@@ ple of minu@@ te@@ s, you have made the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off@@ , and you have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off@@ , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better st@@ ory about his experien@@ ce.
What de@@ fin@@ es a st@@ or@@ y@@ ?
And that is tr@@ ue of the st@@ ori@@ es that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us, and it's also tr@@ ue of the st@@ ori@@ es that we make up@@ .
What de@@ fin@@ es a st@@ ory are chang@@ es, sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant mom@@ ents and en@@ d@@ ing@@ s.
E@@ n@@ d@@ ing@@ s are ver@@ y, very important
an@@ d, in this cas@@ e, the en@@ ding dom@@ in@@ ate@@ d.
Now, the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f li@@ ves its life continu@@ ous@@ l@@ y.
It has mom@@ ents of experien@@ ce, one after the oth@@ er. And you can as@@ k@@ : What happen@@ s to these mom@@ ent@@ s@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is really str@@ ai@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ :
They are l@@ ost fo@@ re@@ ver@@ .
I me@@ an, most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I cal@@ cul@@ ate@@ d, you know, the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical pres@@ ent is sai@@ d to be about three sec@@ on@@ ds l@@ ong@@ ;
that me@@ ans that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 mil@@ lion of the@@ m@@ ;
in a mon@@ th@@ , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 --
most of them don't lea@@ ve a tr@@ ac@@ e.
M@@ ost of them are compl@@ et@@ ely ig@@ no@@ red by the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And y@@ et, some@@ how you get the sen@@ se that they should coun@@ t, that what happen@@ s dur@@ ing these mom@@ ents of experien@@ ce is our lif@@ e.
It's the fin@@ ite res@@ our@@ ce that we're sp@@ en@@ ding wh@@ ile we're on this ear@@ th@@ .
And how to sp@@ end it would se@@ em to be re@@ le@@ v@@ an@@ t, but that is not the st@@ ory that the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f ke@@ ep@@ s for us.
So we have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f and the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ , and they're really qu@@ ite dist@@ in@@ c@@ t.
The bi@@ gg@@ est differen@@ ce between them is in the h@@ and@@ l@@ ing of tim@@ e.
F@@ rom the poin@@ t of vie@@ w of the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation, and the sec@@ ond we@@ e@@ k is just as good as the fir@@ st@@ , then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation.
That's not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
F@@ or the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , a tw@@ o@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is b@@ are@@ ly better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ori@@ es ad@@ de@@ d.
You have not chang@@ ed the st@@ or@@ y.
And in this wa@@ y, time is actually the cr@@ it@@ ical v@@ ari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h@@ es a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f from an experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ ;
time has very little im@@ p@@ act on the st@@ or@@ y.
Now, the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f does more than re@@ mem@@ ber and tell st@@ ori@@ es.
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes dec@@ is@@ ion@@ s bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, if you have a p@@ ati@@ ent who has ha@@ d, say, two col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to ch@@ o@@ os@@ e, then the one that ch@@ o@@ os@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less b@@ ad@@ , and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en@@ .
The experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f has no vo@@ ice in this ch@@ o@@ ice.
We actually don't ch@@ o@@ ose between experien@@ c@@ es, we ch@@ o@@ ose between mem@@ ori@@ es of experien@@ c@@ es.
And even when we think about the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re, we don't think of our f@@ ut@@ ure nor@@ m@@ ally as experien@@ c@@ es.
We think of our f@@ ut@@ ure as ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ori@@ es.
And bas@@ ically you can look at this, you know, as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ n@@ y of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , and you can think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f sort of dr@@ ag@@ g@@ ing the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f through experien@@ ces that the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f doesn't ne@@ ed.
I have that sen@@ se that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly the cas@@ e@@ ; that is, we go on v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s, to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent, in the serv@@ ice of our re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And this is a bit har@@ d to j@@ ust@@ i@@ f@@ y I thin@@ k.
I me@@ an, how much do we con@@ sum@@ e our mem@@ ori@@ es@@ ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ .
And when I think about that, I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ag@@ o, which was c@@ lear@@ ly the b@@ est v@@ ac@@ ation I've ever ha@@ d, and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely of@@ ten@@ , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ation@@ s.
And I probab@@ ly have con@@ sum@@ ed my mem@@ ori@@ es of that thre@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k tri@@ p@@ , I would say, for about 2@@ 5 minu@@ te@@ s in the last f@@ our year@@ s.
Now, if I had ever o@@ pen@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tu@@ res in it, I would have sp@@ ent another h@@ our@@ .
Now, that is three we@@ e@@ k@@ s, and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f@@ .
There se@@ em@@ s to be a disc@@ re@@ pan@@ c@@ y.
Now, I may be a bit ex@@ tre@@ me, you know, in how little ap@@ pet@@ ite I have for con@@ sum@@ ing mem@@ ori@@ es, but even if you do more of this, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine quest@@ ion@@ :
Wh@@ y do we put so much we@@ i@@ ght on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the we@@ i@@ ght that we put on experien@@ ces@@ ?
So I want you to think about a thought exper@@ iment@@ .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tu@@ res will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed, and you@@ 'll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dr@@ u@@ g so that you won@@ 't re@@ mem@@ ber any@@ thing@@ .
Now, would you ch@@ o@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation@@ ?
And if you would ch@@ o@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation, there is a con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between your two sel@@ v@@ es, and you need to think about how to ad@@ j@@ u@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, and it's actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ou@@ s, because if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of tim@@ e, then you get one ans@@ w@@ er,
and if you think in ter@@ m@@ s of mem@@ ori@@ es, you might get another ans@@ w@@ er.
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do
is a prob@@ le@@ m that con@@ fr@@ on@@ ts us with a ch@@ o@@ ice between the two sel@@ v@@ es.
Now, the two sel@@ ves br@@ ing up two no@@ tions of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
There are really two con@@ ce@@ pt@@ s of happ@@ in@@ ess that we can ap@@ pl@@ y, one p@@ er self@@ .
So you can as@@ k@@ : How happ@@ y is the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ ?
And then you would as@@ k@@ : How happ@@ y are the mom@@ ents in the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ 's li@@ fe@@ ?
And they're all -- happ@@ in@@ ess for mom@@ ents
is a fa@@ ir@@ ly compl@@ ic@@ ated proces@@ s.
What are the emo@@ tions that can be m@@ ea@@ su@@ re@@ d@@ ?
An@@ d, by the wa@@ y, now we are cap@@ able of get@@ ting a pret@@ ty good idea of the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f over tim@@ e.
If you as@@ k for the happ@@ in@@ ess of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , it's a compl@@ et@@ ely different thing@@ .
This is not about how happ@@ il@@ y a per@@ son li@@ v@@ es.
It is about how s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed or pl@@ eas@@ ed the per@@ son is when that per@@ son thin@@ ks about her lif@@ e.
V@@ er@@ y different no@@ tion.
An@@ y@@ one who doesn't dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stu@@ dent@@ s of w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing, wh@@ o@@ 've been m@@ ess@@ ing up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ in@@ ess for a l@@ ong time in pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely this wa@@ y.
The dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f and the s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f has been re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ed in rec@@ ent year@@ s, and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e the two se@@ par@@ at@@ el@@ y.
The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than hal@@ f a mil@@ lion people have been as@@ ked quest@@ ion@@ s about what they think of their life and about their experien@@ c@@ es,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es.
So in rec@@ ent year@@ s, we have be@@ g@@ un to lear@@ n about the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es.
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have lear@@ ned is they are really differen@@ t.
You can know how s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed some@@ body is with their lif@@ e, and that really doesn't te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ il@@ y they're li@@ ving their lif@@ e, and v@@ ice vers@@ a.
J@@ ust to give you a sen@@ se of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5@@ . What that me@@ ans is if you me@@ t some@@ bo@@ d@@ y, and you were t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ O@@ h his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght@@ ?
Well, you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght, but there's a lot of unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y. You have that much unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y.
If I tell you that some@@ body ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of ten@@ , you have a lot of unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how happ@@ y they are with their experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low@@ .
We know something about what control@@ s s@@ at@@ is@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ in@@ ess self@@ .
We know that mon@@ ey is very importan@@ t, go@@ als are very importan@@ t.
We know that happ@@ in@@ ess is ma@@ in@@ ly being s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with people that we lik@@ e, sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we lik@@ e.
There are other pl@@ ea@@ su@@ re@@ s, but this is dom@@ in@@ an@@ t.
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ e the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two sel@@ v@@ es, you are going to end up doing very different thing@@ s.
The bo@@ t@@ to@@ m l@@ ine of what I've sai@@ d here is that we really should not think of happ@@ in@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ itu@@ te for w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
It is a compl@@ et@@ ely different no@@ tion.
Now, very qu@@ ick@@ ly, another reas@@ on we can@@ not think str@@ ai@@ ght about happ@@ in@@ ess is that we do not at@@ ten@@ d to the same things when we think about lif@@ e, and we actually li@@ ve.
So, if you as@@ k the sim@@ ple quest@@ ion of how happ@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t ans@@ w@@ er.
When you as@@ k that quest@@ ion@@ , you think people m@@ ust be hap@@ pi@@ er in C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia i@@ f@@ , say, you li@@ ve in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happen@@ s is when you think about li@@ ving in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a, you are thin@@ king of the contr@@ ast between C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia and other plac@@ es, and that contr@@ ast@@ , say, is in cl@@ im@@ ate.
Well, it tur@@ n@@ s out that cl@@ im@@ ate is not very important to the experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f and it's not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive sel@@ f that deci@@ de@@ s how happ@@ y people are.
But no@@ w, because the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive sel@@ f is in ch@@ ar@@ g@@ e, you may end up -- some people may end up mo@@ ving to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a.
And it's sort of interest@@ ing to tr@@ ace what is going to happ@@ en to people who mo@@ ve to C@@ ali@@ for@@ n@@ ia in the ho@@ pe of get@@ ting hap@@ pi@@ er.
Well, their experien@@ c@@ ing sel@@ f is not going to get hap@@ pi@@ er.
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are hap@@ pi@@ er,
bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the w@@ ea@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o, and they will fe@@ el they made the right dec@@ is@@ ion@@ .
It is very diff@@ icul@@ t to think str@@ ai@@ ght about w@@ ell@@ -@@ be@@ ing, and I ho@@ pe I have gi@@ ven you a sen@@ se of how diff@@ icul@@ t it is.
Thank you.
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a quest@@ ion for you.
Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
Now, when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ e@@ ks ag@@ o, you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was qu@@ ite an interest@@ ing res@@ ul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y.
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few mom@@ ents le@@ f@@ t no@@ w@@ ?
D@@ ani@@ el K@@ a@@ hn@@ em@@ an@@ : S@@ u@@ re.
I think the most interest@@ ing res@@ ul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y is a num@@ b@@ er, which we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely did not ex@@ p@@ ect to fin@@ d.
We found that with re@@ spec@@ t to the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ing@@ s, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e.
And it tur@@ n@@ s out that, bel@@ o@@ w an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dol@@ lar@@ s a year@@ , for Americ@@ ans -- and that's a very lar@@ ge s@@ am@@ ple of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ , so it's a lar@@ ge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative s@@ am@@ ple -- bel@@ o@@ w an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dol@@ lar@@ s a year@@ ...
C@@ A@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ .
D@@ K@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ . 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dol@@ lar@@ s a year@@ , people are un@@ happ@@ y, and they get pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the po@@ o@@ re@@ r they get@@ . A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at lin@@ e.
I m@@ ean I've r@@ are@@ ly se@@ en lin@@ es so fl@@ at.
C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happen@@ ing is mon@@ ey does not bu@@ y you experien@@ ti@@ al happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, but l@@ ac@@ k of mon@@ ey cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y, and we can m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e that mis@@ er@@ y ver@@ y, very c@@ lear@@ l@@ y.
In ter@@ m@@ s of the other self@@ , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self@@ , you get a different st@@ or@@ y.
The more mon@@ ey you ear@@ n@@ , the more s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed you are.
That does not h@@ old for emo@@ tion@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y, the wh@@ ole Americ@@ an en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about lif@@ e, li@@ ber@@ t@@ y, the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ in@@ es@@ s.
If people to@@ ok ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ d@@ ing, I me@@ an, it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ side down every@@ thing we belie@@ ve ab@@ ou@@ t, like for exam@@ pl@@ e, ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th@@ .
I@@ s there any ch@@ ance that polit@@ ici@@ an@@ s, that the coun@@ try gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly and r@@ un publi@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y bas@@ ed on it@@ ?
D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ on of the r@@ ole of happ@@ in@@ ess re@@ sear@@ ch in publi@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y.
The re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iti@@ on is going to be s@@ low in the Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es, no quest@@ ion about that, but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, and in other coun@@ tri@@ es it is happen@@ ing.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple are re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thin@@ king of happ@@ in@@ ess when they think of publi@@ c pol@@ ic@@ y.
It's going to take a wh@@ ile, and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy experien@@ ce happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, or wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on. How to en@@ h@@ ance happ@@ in@@ ess go@@ es very different ways de@@ pen@@ ding on how you thin@@ k, and wh@@ e@@ ther you think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing sel@@ f or you think of the experien@@ c@@ ing self@@ .
This is going to inf@@ lu@@ en@@ ce pol@@ ic@@ y, I thin@@ k, in years to com@@ e.
In the Un@@ it@@ ed Stat@@ es, ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e the experien@@ ce happ@@ in@@ ess of the popul@@ ation. This is going to b@@ e, I thin@@ k, with@@ in the next dec@@ a@@ de or tw@@ o, part of n@@ ation@@ al st@@ ati@@ st@@ ic@@ s. C@@ A@@ : Well, it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at lea@@ st should be -- the most interest@@ ing pol@@ ic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ac@@ k over the next few year@@ s.
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s.
Thank you@@ , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ a@@ hn@@ em@@ an.
I'm going to talk to@@ day about energ@@ y and cl@@ im@@ ate.
And that might se@@ em a bit sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ o@@ und@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ ed@@ s, about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and de@@ li@@ ver to hel@@ p the po@@ o@@ res@@ t two bil@@ lion li@@ ve better li@@ v@@ es.
But energ@@ y and cl@@ im@@ ate are ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely important to these people -- in fac@@ t, more important than to any@@ one el@@ se on the plan@@ et.
The cl@@ im@@ ate get@@ ting wor@@ se me@@ ans that many year@@ s, their c@@ ro@@ p@@ s won@@ 't gro@@ w@@ :
There will be to@@ o much ra@@ in, not en@@ ough ra@@ in,
things will change in ways that their fr@@ ag@@ ile en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment simpl@@ y can't sup@@ por@@ t.
And that lea@@ ds to star@@ v@@ ation, it lea@@ ds to unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ t@@ y, it lea@@ ds to un@@ rest@@ .
So, the cl@@ im@@ ate chang@@ es will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them.
Al@@ so@@ , the pr@@ ice of energ@@ y is very important to them.
In fac@@ t, if you could pic@@ k just one thing to low@@ er the pr@@ ice of@@ , to re@@ duc@@ e po@@ ver@@ t@@ y, by f@@ ar you would pic@@ k energ@@ y.
Now, the pr@@ ice of energ@@ y has come down over tim@@ e.
R@@ e@@ ally ad@@ v@@ an@@ ce@@ d ci@@ v@@ iliz@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ v@@ an@@ ces in energ@@ y.
The co@@ al re@@ vol@@ u@@ tion f@@ u@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolu@@ tion@@ , an@@ d, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've se@@ en a very rap@@ id de@@ cl@@ ine in the pr@@ ice of electr@@ ic@@ ity, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or@@ s, a@@ ir@@ -@@ con@@ d@@ iti@@ on@@ ing, we can make mo@@ der@@ n materi@@ als and do so many thing@@ s.
And so@@ , we're in a won@@ der@@ ful s@@ itu@@ ation with electr@@ ic@@ ity in the r@@ ich worl@@ d.
B@@ ut@@ , as we make it ch@@ ea@@ p@@ er -- and let@@ 's go for ma@@ king it tw@@ ice as ch@@ ea@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new constr@@ ain@@ t, and that constr@@ ain@@ t has to do with C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plan@@ et, and the e@@ qu@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very str@@ ai@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d on@@ e.
If you su@@ m up the C@@ O@@ 2 that get@@ s em@@ it@@ te@@ d, that lea@@ ds to a tem@@ per@@ atur@@ e incre@@ as@@ e, and that tem@@ per@@ atur@@ e incre@@ ase lea@@ ds to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ect@@ s@@ :
the eff@@ ect@@ s on the w@@ ea@@ th@@ er@@ ; per@@ hap@@ s wor@@ se, the in@@ direc@@ t eff@@ ect@@ s, in that the natur@@ al ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em@@ s can't ad@@ just to these rap@@ id chang@@ es, and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ st@@ em col@@ l@@ ap@@ s@@ es.
Now, the ex@@ act am@@ oun@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ ta@@ in incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ atur@@ e will be and where the pos@@ iti@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are, there's some unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty the@@ re, but not very mu@@ ch@@ .
And there's cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ect@@ s will b@@ e, but they will be ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely b@@ ad@@ .
I as@@ ked the to@@ p scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s on this se@@ ver@@ al tim@@ es@@ : D@@ o we really have to get down to n@@ ear z@@ er@@ o@@ ?
C@@ an@@ 't we just cut it in hal@@ f or a qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is that un@@ ti@@ l we get n@@ ear to z@@ er@@ o, the tem@@ per@@ atur@@ e will continu@@ e to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e.
It's very different than sa@@ ying "@@ We@@ 're a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ fo@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ hi@@ gh tr@@ uc@@ k trying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ fo@@ o@@ t b@@ ri@@ d@@ g@@ e, and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o.
Now, we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de every year@@ , over 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion t@@ on@@ s.
F@@ or each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 t@@ on@@ s@@ ;
for people in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, it's less than one t@@ on.
It's an a@@ ver@@ age of about fi@@ ve t@@ ons for every@@ one on the plan@@ et.
An@@ d, some@@ ho@@ w, we have to make chang@@ es that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ er@@ o.
It's been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up@@ .
It's only v@@ ari@@ ous econom@@ ic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed it at all@@ , so we have to go from rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing, and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o.
This e@@ qu@@ ation has f@@ our fac@@ tor@@ s,
a little bit of mul@@ ti@@ plic@@ ation@@ :
So, you@@ 've got a thing on the le@@ f@@ t, C@@ O@@ 2@@ , that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o, and that's going to be bas@@ ed on the num@@ ber of peopl@@ e, the serv@@ ic@@ es each person@@ 's using on a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e, the energ@@ y on a@@ ver@@ age for each serv@@ ice, and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out p@@ er un@@ it of energ@@ y.
So, let@@ 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o.
Pro@@ b@@ ab@@ ly, one of these num@@ b@@ ers is going to have to get pret@@ ty n@@ ear to z@@ er@@ o.
Now that's back from hi@@ gh sch@@ oo@@ l al@@ ge@@ br@@ a, but let@@ 's take a loo@@ k.
F@@ ir@@ st@@ , we've got popul@@ ation.
The world to@@ day has 6@@ .@@ 8 bil@@ lion peopl@@ e.
That's hea@@ ded up to about n@@ ine bil@@ li@@ on.
Now, if we do a really great jo@@ b on new v@@ ac@@ cin@@ es, heal@@ th c@@ are, re@@ produc@@ tive heal@@ th serv@@ ic@@ es, we could low@@ er that b@@ y, per@@ hap@@ s, 10 or 1@@ 5 perc@@ ent, but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .
The sec@@ ond fac@@ t@@ or is the serv@@ ic@@ es we us@@ e.
This en@@ comp@@ as@@ s@@ es every@@ thing@@ : the fo@@ od we e@@ at, c@@ lo@@ thing@@ , T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.
Th@@ ese are very good thing@@ s@@ : get@@ ting ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ ty me@@ ans pro@@ vi@@ ding these serv@@ ic@@ es to al@@ most every@@ one on the plan@@ et.
And it's a great thing for this num@@ ber to go up@@ .
In the r@@ ich worl@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s the to@@ p one bil@@ li@@ on, we probab@@ ly could cut back and use l@@ es@@ s, but every year@@ , this num@@ b@@ er, on a@@ ver@@ ag@@ e, is going to go up@@ , and so@@ , over all@@ , that will more than dou@@ ble the serv@@ ic@@ es de@@ li@@ ve@@ red p@@ er person@@ .
H@@ ere we have a very bas@@ ic serv@@ ic@@ e:
D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your h@@ ou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your h@@ om@@ e@@ wor@@ k@@ ?
An@@ d, in fac@@ t, these ki@@ ds don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and read@@ ing their sch@@ oo@@ l work un@@ der the st@@ re@@ et l@@ am@@ p@@ s.
Now, eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y, E@@ , the energ@@ y for each serv@@ ice, here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ w@@ s.
We have something that's not going up@@ .
Th@@ r@@ ough v@@ ari@@ ous in@@ ven@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ ght@@ ing, through different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of car@@ s, different ways of buil@@ ding buil@@ d@@ ing@@ s -- there are a lot of serv@@ ic@@ es where you can br@@ ing the energ@@ y for that serv@@ ice down qu@@ ite sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ all@@ y. S@@ ome indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al serv@@ ic@@ es even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 perc@@ ent.
There are other serv@@ ic@@ es like how we make fer@@ t@@ iliz@@ er, or how we do a@@ ir tran@@ sp@@ or@@ t, where the ro@@ om@@ s for im@@ pro@@ ve@@ ment are f@@ ar, f@@ ar l@@ es@@ s.
And so@@ , o@@ ver@@ all here@@ , if we're op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic, we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ t@@ or of three to ev@@ en, per@@ hap@@ s, a fac@@ t@@ or of si@@ x@@ .
But for these first three fac@@ tor@@ s no@@ w, we've g@@ one from 2@@ 6 bil@@ lion to@@ , at b@@ est@@ , ma@@ ybe 1@@ 3 bil@@ lion t@@ on@@ s, and that just won@@ 't cut it.
So let@@ 's look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ t@@ or -- this is going to be a k@@ ey one -- and this is the am@@ oun@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out p@@ er each un@@ it of energ@@ y.
And so the quest@@ ion is@@ : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o@@ ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al, no@@ .
If you bur@@ n natur@@ al g@@ as@@ , no@@ .
Al@@ most every way we make electr@@ ic@@ ity to@@ day, ex@@ cep@@ t for the em@@ er@@ g@@ ing re@@ ne@@ w@@ ab@@ les and n@@ uc@@ le@@ ar, pu@@ ts out C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
And so@@ , what we're going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ ale, is cre@@ ate a new system@@ .
And so@@ , we need energ@@ y mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
Now, when I use the ter@@ m "@@ mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le@@ ," I don't m@@ ean something that's im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e.
The mic@@ ro@@ proces@@ s@@ or is a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ e. The person@@ al com@@ pute@@ r is a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ e.
The In@@ ter@@ ne@@ t and its serv@@ ic@@ es are a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ e.
So, the people here have part@@ ici@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ r@@ ac@@ l@@ es.
U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le by a cer@@ ta@@ in dat@@ e.
U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of st@@ and b@@ y, and some come al@@ ong@@ , some don@@ '@@ t.
This is a c@@ ase where we actually have to d@@ ri@@ ve at ful@@ l sp@@ e@@ ed and get a mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le in a pret@@ ty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ in@@ e.
Now, I thou@@ ght, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture th@@ is@@ ?
I@@ s there some kind of natur@@ al il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation, some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b peopl@@ e's imagin@@ ation here@@ ?"
I thought back to a y@@ ear ag@@ o when I br@@ ou@@ ght m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ os@@ , and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that.
It really got them in@@ vol@@ ved in the idea of@@ , you know, there are people who li@@ ve with m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ os@@ .
So, with energ@@ y, all I could come up with is this.
I deci@@ ded that re@@ lea@@ s@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment here this year@@ .
So here we have some natur@@ al fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es.
I'm t@@ old they don't b@@ it@@ e@@ ; in fac@@ t, they might not even lea@@ ve that j@@ ar@@ .
Now, there's all sor@@ ts of g@@ im@@ mic@@ k@@ y solu@@ tions like that on@@ e, but they don't really ad@@ d up to mu@@ ch@@ .
We need solu@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or se@@ ver@@ al -- that have un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ bel@@ i@@ ev@@ able re@@ li@@ abil@@ ity, an@@ d, al@@ th@@ ough there's many direc@@ tions people are se@@ e@@ k@@ ing, I really only see fi@@ ve that can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve the big num@@ ber@@ s.
I've le@@ f@@ t out ti@@ de, ge@@ oth@@ er@@ m@@ al, f@@ us@@ ion@@ , bi@@ of@@ u@@ el@@ s.
Th@@ ose may make some con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion@@ , and if they can do better than I ex@@ p@@ ec@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter@@ ,
but my k@@ ey poin@@ t here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ t@@ ing, because they all have sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es.
L@@ et@@ 's look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l f@@ u@@ el@@ s, ei@@ ther bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natur@@ al g@@ as@@ .
What you need to do the@@ re, se@@ em@@ s like it might be simpl@@ e, but it's no@@ t, and that's to take all the C@@ O@@ 2@@ , after you@@ 've bur@@ ned it, going out the f@@ lu@@ e, pres@@ sur@@ iz@@ e it, cre@@ ate a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d, put it some@@ wh@@ ere@@ , and ho@@ pe it sta@@ ys the@@ re.
Now we have some p@@ il@@ o@@ t things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent le@@ vel@@ , but get@@ ting up to that ful@@ l perc@@ ent@@ ag@@ e, that will be very tr@@ ick@@ y, and ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ ant@@ iti@@ es should be put will be har@@ d, but the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est one here is this l@@ ong@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e.
W@@ ho@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
W@@ ho@@ 's going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is lit@@ er@@ ally bil@@ li@@ ons of tim@@ es lar@@ g@@ er than any t@@ y@@ pe of w@@ ast@@ e you think of in ter@@ m@@ s of n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r or other thing@@ s@@ ?
This is a lot of vol@@ um@@ e.
So that's a t@@ ough on@@ e.
N@@ ex@@ t would be n@@ uc@@ lear@@ .
It also has three big problem@@ s@@ :
C@@ o@@ st@@ , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in hi@@ gh@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tri@@ es, is hi@@ gh@@ ;
the is@@ su@@ e of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y, really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go wr@@ ong@@ , that, even th@@ ough you have these human oper@@ at@@ or@@ s, that the f@@ u@@ el doesn't get used for w@@ ea@@ p@@ on@@ s.
And then what do you do with the w@@ ast@@ e?
An@@ d, al@@ th@@ ough it's not very lar@@ g@@ e, there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ n@@ s about that.
P@@ e@@ o@@ ple need to fe@@ el good about it.
So three very t@@ ough problem@@ s that might be sol@@ v@@ abl@@ e, and so@@ , should be wor@@ ked on.
The last three of the fi@@ ve, I've gr@@ ou@@ p@@ ed toge@@ th@@ er.
Th@@ ese are what people of@@ ten re@@ f@@ er to as the re@@ ne@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
And they actually -- al@@ th@@ ough it's great they don't re@@ qu@@ i@@ re f@@ u@@ el -- they have some dis@@ ad@@ v@@ ant@@ ag@@ es.
O@@ ne is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energ@@ y ga@@ the@@ red in these techn@@ ologi@@ es is dr@@ am@@ at@@ ically less than a pow@@ er plan@@ t.
This is energ@@ y f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing, so you're tal@@ king about many s@@ qu@@ are mil@@ es, thou@@ s@@ an@@ ds of time more area than you think of as a nor@@ ma@@ l energ@@ y plan@@ t.
Al@@ so@@ , these are inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ c@@ es.
The s@@ un doesn't sh@@ ine all day, it doesn't sh@@ ine every day, an@@ d, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, the w@@ ind doesn't b@@ low all the tim@@ e.
And so@@ , if you de@@ pen@@ d on these s@@ our@@ c@@ es, you have to have some way of get@@ ting the energ@@ y dur@@ ing those time per@@ io@@ ds that it's not av@@ a@@ il@@ abl@@ e.
So, we've got big c@@ ost ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es here@@ ,
we have trans@@ mis@@ sion ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es@@ :
for exam@@ pl@@ e, say this energ@@ y s@@ our@@ ce is out@@ side your coun@@ tr@@ y@@ ; you not only need the technolog@@ y, but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the energ@@ y com@@ ing from el@@ se@@ wh@@ ere@@ .
An@@ d, fin@@ ally, this st@@ or@@ age problem@@ .
An@@ d, to d@@ imen@@ sion@@ aliz@@ e this, I went through and loo@@ ked at all the t@@ y@@ p@@ es of bat@@ ter@@ i@@ es that get made -- for car@@ s, for com@@ puter@@ s, for ph@@ on@@ es, for fl@@ as@@ h@@ li@@ ght@@ s, for every@@ thing --
and comp@@ are@@ d that to the am@@ oun@@ t of electr@@ ical energ@@ y the world us@@ es, and what I found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ i@@ es we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 minu@@ te@@ s of all the energ@@ y.
And so@@ , in fac@@ t, we need a big bre@@ a@@ k@@ through here@@ , something that's going to be a fac@@ t@@ or of 1@@ 00 better than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have no@@ w.
It's not im@@ possi@@ bl@@ e, but it's not a very eas@@ y thing@@ .
Now, this sho@@ ws up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ o@@ ve, say, 20 to 3@@ 0 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're coun@@ ting on it for 1@@ 00 perc@@ ent, you need an incredi@@ ble mi@@ r@@ ac@@ le bat@@ ter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go for@@ war@@ d on this -- wh@@ at's the right ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ h@@ at@@ t@@ an Pro@@ j@@ ect@@ ? Wh@@ at's the thing that can get us there@@ ?
Well, we need lo@@ ts of comp@@ ani@@ es wor@@ king on this, h@@ un@@ dre@@ d@@ s.
In each of these fi@@ ve pa@@ th@@ s, we need at lea@@ st a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d peopl@@ e.
And a lot of the@@ m, you@@ 'll look at and say, "@@ Th@@ ey@@ 're c@@ ra@@ z@@ y@@ ." That's go@@ o@@ d.
An@@ d, I thin@@ k, here in the TED gr@@ ou@@ p@@ , we have many people who are al@@ read@@ y p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this.
B@@ ill G@@ ros@@ s has se@@ ver@@ al comp@@ ani@@ es, in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar th@@ er@@ ma@@ l techn@@ ologi@@ es.
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la@@ 's in@@ vest@@ ing in do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es that are doing great things and have interest@@ ing possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es, and I'm trying to hel@@ p back that.
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a comp@@ any that, per@@ hap@@ s sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing@@ ly, is actually ta@@ king the n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
There are some in@@ no@@ v@@ ations in n@@ uc@@ lear@@ : mod@@ ul@@ ar, li@@ qu@@ i@@ d.
And in@@ no@@ v@@ ation really st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in this indu@@ str@@ y qu@@ ite some ag@@ o, so the idea that there's some good ide@@ as la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing.
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ w@@ er is that, inst@@ ea@@ d of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one perc@@ ent, which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we deci@@ de@@ d, "@@ L@@ et@@ 's bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ."
It is kind of a c@@ ra@@ z@@ y ide@@ a.
In fac@@ t, people had tal@@ ked about it for a l@@ ong tim@@ e, but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly wh@@ e@@ ther it would work or no@@ t,
and so it's through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ der@@ n su@@ per@@ com@@ puter@@ s that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right materi@@ al@@ 's ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ , this loo@@ ks like it would wor@@ k.
An@@ d, because you're bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ved c@@ ost pro@@ fil@@ e.
You actually bur@@ n up the w@@ ast@@ e, and you can actually use as f@@ u@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver w@@ ast@@ e from to@@ da@@ y@@ 's re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s.
So, inst@@ ea@@ d of wor@@ r@@ ying about the@@ m, you just take that. It's a great thing@@ .
It bre@@ a@@ the@@ s this ur@@ ani@@ um as it go@@ es al@@ ong@@ , so it's kind of like a c@@ and@@ l@@ e.
You can see it's a lo@@ g the@@ re, of@@ ten re@@ fer@@ red to as a tr@@ av@@ el@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ act@@ or.
In ter@@ m@@ s of f@@ u@@ el@@ , this really sol@@ ves the problem@@ .
I've got a pic@@ ture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y.
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ , the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, where they@@ 've ta@@ k@@ en out the part they bur@@ n no@@ w,
so it's called de@@ pl@@ e@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um@@ .
That would pow@@ er the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of year@@ s.
An@@ d, simpl@@ y by fil@@ ter@@ ing sea@@ wat@@ er in an in@@ ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve proces@@ s, you@@ '@@ d have en@@ ough f@@ u@@ el for the enti@@ re lif@@ et@@ ime of the res@@ t of the plan@@ et.
So, you know, it's got lo@@ ts of ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es a@@ hea@@ d, but it is an exam@@ ple of the many h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds and h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of ide@@ as that we need to mo@@ ve for@@ war@@ d.
So let@@ 's thin@@ k@@ : How should we m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e our@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ ?
What should our re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look li@@ ke@@ ?
Well, let@@ 's go out to where we really need to get@@ , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate.
F@@ or 20@@ 5@@ 0@@ , you@@ 've hear@@ d many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion.
That really is very importan@@ t, that we get the@@ re.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es, still some ag@@ r@@ icul@@ tu@@ re,
ho@@ pe@@ ful@@ ly we will have c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up fo@@ re@@ str@@ y, ce@@ ment@@ .
So, to get to that 8@@ 0 perc@@ ent, the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es, in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding coun@@ tri@@ es like Ch@@ in@@ a, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their electr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ toge@@ th@@ er.
So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : A@@ re we de@@ pl@@ o@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technolog@@ y, have we de@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ed it in all the devel@@ op@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es and we're in the pro@@ c@@ ess of get@@ ting it el@@ se@@ wh@@ ere@@ ?
That's sup@@ er importan@@ t.
That's a k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ent of ma@@ king that re@@ por@@ t car@@ d.
So, bac@@ king up from the@@ re, what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look li@@ ke@@ ?
Well, again@@ , it should have the two el@@ em@@ ent@@ s.
We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ en@@ c@@ y m@@ ea@@ su@@ res to start get@@ ting re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s@@ :
The less we em@@ it, the less that su@@ m will be of C@@ O@@ 2@@ , an@@ d, there@@ fo@@ re, the less the tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ re.
But in some wa@@ y@@ s, the gra@@ de we get the@@ re, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s, is only e@@ qu@@ ally, or ma@@ ybe even s@@ li@@ ght@@ ly l@@ es@@ s, important than the oth@@ er, which is the pi@@ ec@@ e of in@@ no@@ v@@ ation on these bre@@ a@@ k@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s.
Th@@ ese bre@@ a@@ k@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s, we need to mo@@ ve those at ful@@ l sp@@ e@@ ed, and we can m@@ ea@@ sur@@ e that in ter@@ m@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es, p@@ il@@ o@@ t pro@@ j@@ ect@@ s, reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
Th@@ ere's a lot of great bo@@ o@@ ks that have been wr@@ it@@ ten about this.
The A@@ l G@@ ore bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ O@@ ur C@@ ho@@ ic@@ e@@ " and the D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ K@@ a@@ y bo@@ o@@ k, "@@ S@@ ust@@ ain@@ able E@@ ner@@ g@@ y W@@ i@@ th@@ out the Ho@@ t A@@ ir@@ ."
They really go through it and cre@@ ate a fr@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ s@@ ed b@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need b@@ ro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.
Th@@ ere's a lot that has to come toge@@ th@@ er.
So this is a w@@ is@@ h@@ .
It's a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ is@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technolog@@ y.
If you ga@@ ve me only one w@@ is@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k wh@@ o@@ 's pre@@ si@@ dent@@ , I could pic@@ k a v@@ ac@@ cin@@ e, which is something I lo@@ ve, or I could pic@@ k that this thing that's hal@@ f the c@@ ost with no C@@ O@@ 2 get@@ s in@@ ven@@ ted --
this is the w@@ is@@ h I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est im@@ pac@@ t.
If we don't get this w@@ is@@ h, the di@@ vis@@ ion between the people who think sh@@ or@@ t ter@@ m and l@@ ong ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ bl@@ e, between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Ch@@ in@@ a, between po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es and r@@ ic@@ h, and most of all the li@@ ves of those two bil@@ lion will be f@@ ar wor@@ s@@ e.
So, what do we have to do@@ ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to st@@ ep for@@ war@@ d and d@@ ri@@ ve@@ ?
We need to go for more re@@ sear@@ ch fund@@ ing.
When coun@@ tri@@ es get toge@@ ther in plac@@ es like C@@ o@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen@@ , they sh@@ oul@@ dn't just disc@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2@@ .
They should disc@@ us@@ s this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation ag@@ en@@ d@@ a,
and you@@ '@@ d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly low le@@ vel@@ s of sp@@ en@@ ding on these in@@ no@@ v@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es.
We do need the mark@@ et in@@ cen@@ ti@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x@@ , ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that get@@ s that pr@@ ice sig@@ n@@ al out the@@ re.
We need to get the m@@ ess@@ age ou@@ t.
We need to have this di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e be a more r@@ ation@@ al, more underst@@ and@@ able di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e, in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the st@@ ep@@ s that the go@@ vern@@ ment ta@@ k@@ es.
This is an important w@@ is@@ h, but it is one I think we can ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to underst@@ and more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ w@@ er, right -- I me@@ an, first of all@@ , can you give a sen@@ se of what sc@@ ale of in@@ vest@@ ment this is@@ ?
B@@ il G@@ at@@ es@@ : T@@ o actually do the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are, bu@@ y the su@@ per@@ com@@ puter@@ , hi@@ re all the great scien@@ ti@@ st@@ s, which we've don@@ e, that's only ten@@ s of mil@@ li@@ on@@ s,
and even on@@ ce we te@@ st our materi@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ act@@ or to make sur@@ e that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly, then you@@ 'll only be up in the h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of mil@@ li@@ on@@ s.
The t@@ ough thing is buil@@ ding the p@@ il@@ o@@ t re@@ ac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the se@@ ver@@ al bil@@ li@@ on, fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ at@@ or, the loc@@ ation that will actually buil@@ d the first one of th@@ es@@ e.
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t, if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ d, then it's just cl@@ ear as day, because the econom@@ ic@@ s, the energ@@ y den@@ s@@ ity, are so different than n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r as we know it.
C@@ A@@ : And so@@ , to underst@@ and it ri@@ ght, this in@@ vol@@ ves buil@@ ding de@@ ep into the gro@@ und al@@ most like a ver@@ tic@@ al kind of col@@ um@@ n of n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r f@@ u@@ el@@ , of this sort of sp@@ ent ur@@ ani@@ um, and then the pro@@ c@@ ess star@@ ts at the to@@ p and kind of wor@@ ks do@@ wn@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : That's ri@@ gh@@ t. To@@ day, you're al@@ ways re@@ f@@ u@@ el@@ ing the re@@ act@@ or, so you have lo@@ ts of people and lo@@ ts of control@@ s that can go wr@@ ong@@ : that thing where you're o@@ pen@@ ing it up and mo@@ ving things in and ou@@ t,
that's not go@@ o@@ d.
So, if you have very ch@@ ea@@ p f@@ u@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ iti@@ es.
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ n@@ s for the 6@@ 0 year@@ s, and then it's don@@ e.
C@@ A@@ : It's a n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r pow@@ er pl@@ ant that is its own w@@ ast@@ e disp@@ os@@ al solu@@ tion.
B@@ G@@ : Y@@ ea@@ h@@ . Well, what happen@@ s with the w@@ ast@@ e, you can le@@ t it s@@ it there -- there's a lot less w@@ ast@@ e un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and bur@@ n that.
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the w@@ ast@@ e that exist@@ s to@@ day, that's sit@@ ting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or dr@@ y cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s --
that's our f@@ u@@ el to be@@ g@@ in with@@ .
So, the thing that's been a prob@@ le@@ m from those re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s is actually what get@@ s f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ um@@ e of the w@@ ast@@ e qu@@ ite dr@@ am@@ at@@ ically as you're going through this proces@@ s.
C@@ A@@ : I me@@ an, you're tal@@ king to different people around the world about the possi@@ bil@@ iti@@ es here@@ . Wh@@ ere is there most interes@@ t in actually doing something with th@@ is@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we ha@@ ven@@ 't pic@@ ked a partic@@ ul@@ ar plac@@ e, and there's all these interest@@ ing disc@@ l@@ os@@ ure r@@ ul@@ es about any@@ thing that's called "@@ n@@ uc@@ lear@@ ,"
so we've got a lot of interest@@ , that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, Ch@@ ina --
I've been back se@@ e@@ ing the sec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energ@@ y here@@ , tal@@ king about how this f@@ its into the energ@@ y ag@@ en@@ d@@ a.
So I'm op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic. You know, the F@@ ren@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have d@@ one some wor@@ k.
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.
It's an important ad@@ v@@ an@@ ce, but it's like a f@@ ast re@@ act@@ or, and a lot of coun@@ tri@@ es have buil@@ t the@@ m, so any@@ body wh@@ o@@ 's d@@ one a f@@ ast re@@ act@@ or is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one get@@ s buil@@ t.
C@@ A@@ : So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ esc@@ ale and lik@@ el@@ i@@ ho@@ od of actually ta@@ king something like this li@@ ve@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, we need -- for one of these hi@@ gh@@ -@@ sc@@ ale, electr@@ o@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that's very ch@@ ea@@ p@@ , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ pl@@ o@@ y.
That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ l@@ ine that the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al mode@@ l@@ s have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et.
An@@ d, you know, T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ w@@ er, if things go w@@ ell -- which is w@@ is@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ il@@ y me@@ et that.
And there are, for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely no@@ w, do@@ z@@ en@@ s of comp@@ ani@@ es -- we need it to be h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds -- wh@@ o, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, if their scien@@ ce go@@ es w@@ ell, if the f@@ un@@ ding for their p@@ il@@ o@@ t pl@@ ant@@ s go@@ es w@@ ell, that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this.
And it's b@@ est if mul@@ ti@@ ple suc@@ ce@@ ed, because then you could use a mi@@ x of these thing@@ s.
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to suc@@ ce@@ ed.
C@@ A@@ : In ter@@ m@@ s of bi@@ g@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possi@@ ble g@@ ame chang@@ es, is this the bi@@ gg@@ est that you're a@@ w@@ are of out there@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : A@@ n energ@@ y bre@@ a@@ k@@ through is the most important thing@@ .
It would have be@@ en, even with@@ out the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al constr@@ ain@@ t, but the en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment@@ al constr@@ ain@@ t just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ at@@ er.
In the n@@ uc@@ lea@@ r sp@@ ac@@ e, there are other in@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ s.
You know, we don't know their work as w@@ ell as we know this on@@ e, but the mod@@ ul@@ ar peopl@@ e, that's a different ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ .
Th@@ ere's a li@@ qu@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ t@@ y@@ pe re@@ act@@ or, which se@@ em@@ s a little har@@ d, but ma@@ ybe they say that about us.
And so@@ , there are different on@@ es,
but the b@@ ea@@ ut@@ y of this is a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e of ur@@ ani@@ um has a mil@@ lion tim@@ es as much energ@@ y as a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ e of@@ , say, co@@ al,
and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ati@@ v@@ es, which are es@@ sen@@ ti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the fo@@ o@@ t@@ prin@@ t and co@@ st@@ , the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al, in ter@@ m@@ s of eff@@ ect on l@@ and and v@@ ari@@ ous thing@@ s, is al@@ most in a clas@@ s of its o@@ wn@@ .
C@@ A@@ : If this doesn't wor@@ k, then wh@@ at@@ ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ c@@ y m@@ ea@@ su@@ res to try and ke@@ ep the tem@@ per@@ atur@@ e of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : If you get into that s@@ itu@@ ation, it's like if you@@ 've been o@@ ver@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a hear@@ t at@@ t@@ ac@@ k@@ :
Th@@ en where do you go@@ ? You may need hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y or some@@ thing@@ .
There is a l@@ ine of re@@ sear@@ ch on wh@@ at's called ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing, which are v@@ ari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would de@@ la@@ y the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 3@@ 0 years to get our act toge@@ th@@ er.
Now, that's just an in@@ sur@@ ance pol@@ ic@@ y.
You ho@@ pe you don't need to do that.
S@@ ome people say you sh@@ oul@@ dn't even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance pol@@ ic@@ y because it might make you l@@ az@@ y, that you@@ 'll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you.
I'm not sur@@ e that's w@@ is@@ e, gi@@ ven the import@@ ance of the problem@@ , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ en@@ gin@@ e@@ er@@ ing disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ c@@ k@@ et in c@@ ase things happ@@ en f@@ ast@@ er, or this in@@ no@@ v@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ low@@ er than we ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ?
C@@ A@@ : C@@ l@@ im@@ ate s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ s@@ : If you had a s@@ ent@@ en@@ ce or two to say to the@@ m, how might you per@@ su@@ a@@ de them that they're wr@@ ong@@ ?
B@@ G@@ : Well, un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, the s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ s come in different cam@@ p@@ s.
The on@@ es who make scien@@ ti@@ fi@@ c ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are very fe@@ w.
A@@ re they sa@@ ying that there's ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ect@@ s that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ se@@ t thing@@ s@@ ?
There are ver@@ y, very few things that they can even say
there's a ch@@ ance in a mil@@ lion of those thing@@ s.
The ma@@ in prob@@ le@@ m we have here@@ , it's kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S@@ .
You make the m@@ ist@@ a@@ ke no@@ w, and you pa@@ y for it a lot lat@@ er.
And so@@ , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s, the idea of ta@@ king pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in lat@@ er, and a some@@ what unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in pa@@ in thing --
in fac@@ t, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ por@@ t, that's not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ il@@ y the wor@@ st cas@@ e, and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "@@ O@@ K@@ , that is@@ n't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."
The fac@@ t is it's that unc@@ er@@ ta@@ in part that should mo@@ ve us to@@ war@@ ds this.
But my dre@@ am here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic, and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 constr@@ ain@@ t@@ s, then the s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ s say, "@@ O@@ K@@ , I don't care that it doesn't put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , I kind of w@@ is@@ h it did put out C@@ O@@ 2@@ , but I gu@@ ess I'@@ ll ac@@ cep@@ t it because it's ch@@ ea@@ p@@ er than wh@@ at's come be@@ fo@@ re@@ ."
C@@ A@@ : And so@@ , that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent, that bas@@ ically if you sp@@ end all this energ@@ y trying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem@@ , it's going to take a@@ way all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and m@@ al@@ ar@@ ia and so for@@ th@@ , it's a stu@@ pi@@ d w@@ ast@@ e of the E@@ ar@@ th@@ 's res@@ our@@ ces to put mon@@ ey to@@ war@@ ds that when there are better things we can do@@ .
B@@ G@@ : Well, the actu@@ al sp@@ en@@ ding on the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ec@@ e -- say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should sp@@ end 10 bil@@ lion a y@@ ear more than it is right now -- it's not that dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic.
It sh@@ oul@@ dn't take a@@ way from other thing@@ s.
The thing you get into big mon@@ ey on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ re@@ e, is when you have something that's n@@ on@@ -@@ econom@@ ic and you're trying to f@@ und that --
that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a w@@ ast@@ e. Un@@ less you're very cl@@ ose and you're just f@@ un@@ ding the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very ch@@ ea@@ p@@ ,
I belie@@ ve we should try more things that have a po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al to be f@@ ar less ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve.
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ L@@ et@@ 's make energ@@ y sup@@ er ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve@@ ," then the r@@ ich can af@@ for@@ d that.
I me@@ an, all of us here could pa@@ y fi@@ ve tim@@ es as much for our energ@@ y and not change our lif@@ est@@ y@@ l@@ e.
The dis@@ ast@@ er is for that two bil@@ li@@ on.
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is, "@@ Wh@@ y is@@ n't the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D get@@ ting more disc@@ us@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
H@@ e's st@@ ill@@ , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stu@@ ff@@ , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic cam@@ p@@ , but he@@ 's realiz@@ ed that's a pret@@ ty l@@ on@@ ely cam@@ p@@ , and so@@ , he@@ 's ma@@ king the R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D poin@@ t.
And so there is a thre@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate.
The R@@ &@@ am@@ p@@ ;@@ D pi@@ ec@@ e, it's c@@ ra@@ z@@ y how little it's f@@ un@@ de@@ d.
C@@ A@@ : W@@ ell B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I sp@@ ea@@ k on the be@@ hal@@ f of most people here to say I really ho@@ pe your w@@ is@@ h com@@ es tr@@ u@@ e. Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .
B@@ G@@ : Thank you.
I'@@ d like to sh@@ are with you a di@@ sco@@ very that I made a few mon@@ th@@ s ag@@ o wh@@ ile wr@@ it@@ ing an ar@@ tic@@ le for It@@ ali@@ an W@@ i@@ re@@ d.
I al@@ ways ke@@ ep my th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us h@@ and@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I'm wr@@ it@@ ing any@@ thing@@ ,
but I'@@ d al@@ read@@ y fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed ed@@ it@@ ing the pi@@ ec@@ e, and I realiz@@ ed that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d "@@ dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d@@ " to see what I'@@ d fin@@ d.
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the en@@ tr@@ y.
"@@ D@@ is@@ ab@@ le@@ d, ad@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve@@ : c@@ ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed, hel@@ pl@@ es@@ s, us@@ el@@ es@@ s, w@@ rec@@ ke@@ d, st@@ al@@ le@@ d, ma@@ im@@ ed, w@@ oun@@ de@@ d, man@@ g@@ le@@ d, l@@ am@@ e, m@@ ut@@ il@@ ate@@ d, r@@ un@@ -@@ do@@ wn@@ , wor@@ n@@ -@@ ou@@ t, w@@ ea@@ k@@ en@@ ed, im@@ po@@ t@@ ent, c@@ astr@@ ate@@ d, par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed, han@@ dic@@ ap@@ pe@@ d, sen@@ ile, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, la@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ up@@ , don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d@@ -@@ up@@ , coun@@ te@@ d@@ -@@ out@@ ;

An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s, heal@@ th@@ y, str@@ ong@@ , cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing,
it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ou@@ s,
but I'@@ d just go@@ t@@ ten p@@ ast "@@ man@@ g@@ le@@ d@@ ," and my vo@@ ice b@@ ro@@ k@@ e, and I had to st@@ o@@ p and col@@ l@@ ect m@@ y@@ sel@@ f from the emo@@ tion@@ al sho@@ c@@ k and im@@ p@@ act that the as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t from these wor@@ ds un@@ lea@@ sh@@ ed.
You know, of cour@@ se, this is my r@@ ag@@ ge@@ dy old th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us
so I'm thin@@ king this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent prin@@ t dat@@ e, ri@@ ght@@ ?
B@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, the prin@@ t d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, when I would have been star@@ ting prim@@ ary sch@@ oo@@ l and form@@ ing an underst@@ and@@ ing of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f out@@ side the famil@@ y un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other ki@@ ds and the world around m@@ e.
An@@ d, ne@@ ed@@ less to say, th@@ ank G@@ od I was@@ n't using a th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us back th@@ en@@ .
I me@@ an, from this en@@ tr@@ y, it would se@@ em that I was bor@@ n into a world that per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing pos@@ iti@@ ve wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for the@@ m,
when in fac@@ t, to@@ day I'm cel@@ e@@ br@@ ated for the op@@ port@@ un@@ iti@@ es and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ re@@ d.
So, I im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ l@@ ine ed@@ iti@@ on, ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ing to find a re@@ vis@@ ion wor@@ th no@@ t@@ ing.
H@@ ere's the up@@ dat@@ ed ver@@ sion of this en@@ tr@@ y.
Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ el@@ y, it's not much bet@@ ter@@ .
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der "@@ N@@ ear An@@ t@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly un@@ s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ing@@ : "@@ wh@@ ol@@ e@@ " and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ om@@ e@@ ."
So, it's not just about the wor@@ d@@ s.
It's what we belie@@ ve about people when we n@@ ame them with these wor@@ d@@ s.
It's about the val@@ u@@ es be@@ h@@ ind the wor@@ ds, and how we constr@@ uc@@ t those val@@ u@@ es.
O@@ ur l@@ ang@@ u@@ age a@@ ff@@ ect@@ s our thin@@ king and how we vie@@ w the world and how we vie@@ w other peopl@@ e.
In fac@@ t, many an@@ ci@@ ent soci@@ e@@ ti@@ es, in@@ cl@@ u@@ ding the G@@ re@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ an@@ s, belie@@ ved that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so pow@@ er@@ f@@ ul, because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d br@@ ou@@ ght it into exist@@ en@@ ce.
So, what real@@ ity do we want to c@@ all into exist@@ en@@ ce@@ :
a per@@ son who is l@@ imit@@ ed, or a per@@ son wh@@ o@@ 's em@@ pow@@ ere@@ d@@ ?
B@@ y cas@@ u@@ ally doing something as sim@@ ple as n@@ am@@ ing a person@@ , a chil@@ d, we might be put@@ ting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on their pow@@ er.
W@@ oul@@ dn't we want to op@@ en do@@ or@@ s for them inst@@ ea@@ d@@ ?
O@@ ne s@@ uch per@@ son who o@@ pen@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me was my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od do@@ c@@ t@@ or at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ itu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ a@@ w@@ are.
H@@ is n@@ ame was D@@ r@@ . P@@ iz@@ z@@ ut@@ il@@ lo@@ ,
an It@@ ali@@ an Americ@@ an, wh@@ ose n@@ am@@ e, ap@@ p@@ aren@@ t@@ ly, was to@@ o diff@@ icul@@ t for most Americ@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ unc@@ e,
so he went by D@@ r@@ . P@@ .
And D@@ r@@ . P al@@ ways wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ti@@ es and had the very per@@ f@@ ect disp@@ os@@ iti@@ on to work with childre@@ n@@ .
I lo@@ ved al@@ most every@@ thing about my time sp@@ ent at this h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al, with the ex@@ cep@@ tion of my ph@@ ys@@ ical th@@ er@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ sion@@ s.
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like in@@ num@@ er@@ able re@@ pet@@ iti@@ ons of ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ ast@@ ic ban@@ ds -- different col@@ or@@ s, you know -- to hel@@ p buil@@ d up my le@@ g mus@@ cl@@ es,
and I h@@ ated these ban@@ ds more than any@@ thing --
I h@@ ated the@@ m, had n@@ am@@ es for them. I h@@ ated them.
An@@ d, you know, I was al@@ read@@ y b@@ ar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a fi@@ ve year@@ -@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es, un@@ suc@@ ces@@ s@@ ful@@ ly, of cour@@ s@@ e.
An@@ d, one day, he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion --
ex@@ ha@@ ust@@ i@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these s@@ es@@ si@@ ons --
and he sai@@ d to me, "@@ W@@ o@@ w. A@@ im@@ e@@ e, you are s@@ uch a str@@ ong and pow@@ er@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l@@ , I think you're going to bre@@ a@@ k one of those b@@ and@@ s. When you do bre@@ a@@ k it, I'm going to give you a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d buc@@ k@@ s@@ ." Now, of cour@@ se, this was a sim@@ ple pl@@ o@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es I didn't want to do be@@ fore the pr@@ os@@ p@@ ect of being the r@@ ic@@ h@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old in the sec@@ ond f@@ lo@@ or war@@ d,
but what he eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ il@@ y oc@@ cur@@ ren@@ ce into a new and pr@@ om@@ is@@ ing experien@@ ce for m@@ e.
And I have to won@@ der to@@ day to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vis@@ ion and his de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and pow@@ er@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l s@@ hap@@ ed my own vie@@ w of m@@ y@@ sel@@ f as an in@@ h@@ eren@@ t@@ ly str@@ ong@@ , pow@@ er@@ ful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic per@@ son w@@ ell into the f@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
This is an exam@@ ple of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in pos@@ iti@@ ons of pow@@ er can ig@@ n@@ ite the pow@@ er of a chil@@ d.
B@@ ut@@ , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ an@@ ces of those th@@ es@@ a@@ ur@@ us en@@ tri@@ es, our l@@ ang@@ u@@ age is@@ n't al@@ low@@ ing us to evol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all wan@@ t, the possi@@ bil@@ ity of an indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al to see the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves as cap@@ abl@@ e.
O@@ ur l@@ ang@@ u@@ age ha@@ s@@ n't c@@ au@@ ght up with the chang@@ es in our societ@@ y, many of which have been br@@ ou@@ ght about by technolog@@ y.
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, from a medic@@ al st@@ and@@ poin@@ t, my leg@@ s, l@@ as@@ er sur@@ g@@ er@@ y for vis@@ ion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment@@ , tit@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bo@@ di@@ es that are al@@ low@@ ing people to more ful@@ ly eng@@ age with their abil@@ iti@@ es, and mo@@ ve be@@ y@@ ond the l@@ im@@ its that natur@@ e has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion soci@@ al n@@ et@@ wor@@ king pl@@ at@@ form@@ s al@@ low people to self@@ -@@ i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y, to cl@@ a@@ im their own de@@ scri@@ p@@ tions of the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es, so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with glob@@ al gr@@ ou@@ p@@ s of their own ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing.
So, per@@ hap@@ s technolog@@ y is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has al@@ ways been a tr@@ u@@ th@@ :
that every@@ one has something r@@ are and pow@@ er@@ ful to off@@ er our societ@@ y, and that the human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ s@@ et.
The human abil@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t, it's an interest@@ ing thing@@ , because people have continu@@ ally wan@@ ted to talk to me about o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ ity, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ :
This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I al@@ ways fel@@ t un@@ eas@@ y trying to ans@@ w@@ er peopl@@ e's quest@@ ion@@ s about it,
and I think I'm star@@ ting to fi@@ g@@ ure out wh@@ y.
I@@ mpl@@ ic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of "@@ o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ it@@ y@@ " is the idea that suc@@ ces@@ s, or happ@@ in@@ es@@ s, is about em@@ er@@ g@@ ing on the other side of a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing experien@@ ce un@@ sc@@ a@@ the@@ d or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experien@@ ce, as if my suc@@ ces@@ s@@ es in life have come about from an abil@@ ity to si@@ dest@@ ep or ci@@ r@@ cum@@ n@@ a@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of a life with pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s, or what other people per@@ ce@@ i@@ ve as my dis@@ abil@@ ity.
B@@ ut@@ , in fac@@ t, we are ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d. We are mar@@ ke@@ d, of cour@@ se, by a ch@@ all@@ eng@@ e, wh@@ e@@ ther ph@@ ys@@ ic@@ ally, emo@@ tion@@ ally or bo@@ th@@ .
And I'm going to su@@ gg@@ est that this is a good thing@@ .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is@@ n't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in or@@ der to res@@ um@@ e li@@ ving our lif@@ e.
It's part of our lif@@ e.
And I ten@@ d to think of it like my s@@ ha@@ do@@ w.
S@@ om@@ et@@ im@@ es I see a lot of it, som@@ et@@ im@@ es there's very lit@@ t@@ l@@ e, but it's al@@ ways with m@@ e.
An@@ d, cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, I'm not trying to d@@ im@@ in@@ is@@ h the im@@ pac@@ t, the we@@ i@@ ght, of a person@@ 's str@@ ug@@ gl@@ e.
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge in lif@@ e, and it's all very real and rel@@ ative to every sing@@ le person@@ , but the quest@@ ion is@@ n't wh@@ e@@ ther or not you're going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ ity, but how you're going to me@@ et it.
So, our respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity is not simpl@@ y shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity, but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it w@@ ell@@ .
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our ki@@ ds when we make them fe@@ el that they're not e@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t.
Th@@ ere's an important differen@@ ce and dist@@ in@@ c@@ tion between the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive medic@@ al fac@@ t of my being an am@@ pute@@ e and the sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tive societ@@ al op@@ in@@ ion of wh@@ e@@ ther or not I'm dis@@ ab@@ le@@ d.
An@@ d, tr@@ u@@ th@@ ful@@ ly, the only real and con@@ sist@@ ent dis@@ abil@@ ity I've had to con@@ fr@@ on@@ t is the world ever thin@@ king that I could be de@@ scri@@ b@@ ed by those de@@ fin@@ iti@@ on@@ s.
In our de@@ si@@ re to prote@@ c@@ t those we care about by gi@@ ving them the col@@ d, har@@ d tr@@ ut@@ h about their medic@@ al pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is, or, in@@ de@@ ed, a pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is on the ex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted qu@@ al@@ ity of their lif@@ e, we have to make sur@@ e that we don't put the first br@@ ic@@ k in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ on@@ e.
P@@ er@@ hap@@ s the exist@@ ing mode@@ l of only looking at what is b@@ ro@@ k@@ en in you and how do we fi@@ x it, ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ abl@@ ing to the indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self@@ .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person@@ , by not ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ing their po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, we are cre@@ ating another ill on to@@ p of wh@@ ate@@ ver natur@@ al str@@ ug@@ g@@ le they might ha@@ ve.
We are eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely gr@@ ad@@ ing some@@ on@@ e's wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity.
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the r@@ ang@@ e of human cap@@ abil@@ ity.
An@@ d, most import@@ ant@@ ly, there's a part@@ ner@@ shi@@ p between those per@@ ce@@ i@@ ved de@@ f@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative abil@@ ity.
So it's not about dev@@ al@@ u@@ ing, or ne@@ g@@ at@@ ing, these more trying tim@@ es as something we want to a@@ vo@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the r@@ ug@@ , but inst@@ ea@@ d to find those op@@ port@@ un@@ iti@@ es wr@@ ap@@ p@@ ed in the ad@@ vers@@ ity.
So ma@@ ybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much o@@ ver@@ com@@ ing ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is o@@ pen@@ ing our@@ sel@@ ves up to it, em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it, grap@@ pl@@ ing with it, to use a w@@ rest@@ l@@ ing ter@@ m, ma@@ ybe even d@@ an@@ c@@ ing with it.
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natur@@ al, con@@ sist@@ ent and us@@ ef@@ ul, we're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pre@@ sen@@ ce of it.
This y@@ ear we cel@@ e@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th bi@@ r@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in, and it was 1@@ 50 years ag@@ o, when wr@@ it@@ ing about evolu@@ tion@@ , that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate@@ d, I thin@@ k, a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ .
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ as@@ e: It's not the str@@ ong@@ est of the speci@@ es that sur@@ vi@@ v@@ es, n@@ or is it the most intel@@ li@@ g@@ ent that sur@@ vi@@ v@@ es@@ ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to chang@@ e.
Con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation.
F@@ rom D@@ ar@@ w@@ in@@ 's wor@@ k, am@@ ong@@ st oth@@ er@@ s, we can re@@ co@@ g@@ n@@ iz@@ e that the human abil@@ ity to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ our@@ is@@ h is d@@ ri@@ ven by the str@@ ug@@ g@@ le of the human sp@@ ir@@ it through con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation.
So, again@@ , trans@@ form@@ ation, ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation, is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ ill@@ .
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, un@@ ti@@ l we're te@@ st@@ ed, we don't know what we're made of@@ .
M@@ a@@ ybe that's what ad@@ vers@@ ity gi@@ ves us@@ : a sen@@ se of self@@ , a sen@@ se of our own pow@@ er.
So, we can give our@@ sel@@ ves a gi@@ f@@ t.
We can re@@ -@@ imag@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough tim@@ es.
M@@ a@@ ybe we can see it as chang@@ e.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we ha@@ ven@@ 't ad@@ ap@@ ted our@@ sel@@ ves to y@@ et.
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we've cre@@ ated for our@@ sel@@ ves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y.
Now, wh@@ o@@ 's nor@@ m@@ al@@ ?
Th@@ ere's no nor@@ m@@ al.
Th@@ ere's com@@ mon@@ , there's t@@ y@@ pic@@ al. Th@@ ere's no nor@@ m@@ al,
and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or, be@@ i@@ ge per@@ son if they exist@@ ed@@ ?
I don't think so@@ .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ di@@ g@@ m from one of ac@@ hi@@ ev@@ ing nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y to one of possi@@ bil@@ ity -- or po@@ ten@@ c@@ y, to be even a little bit more d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous -- we can re@@ lea@@ se the pow@@ er of so many more childre@@ n@@ , and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abil@@ iti@@ es with the commun@@ ity.
An@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ olog@@ ist@@ s tell us that the one thing we as h@@ um@@ ans have al@@ ways re@@ qu@@ i@@ red of our commun@@ ity mem@@ b@@ ers is to be of us@@ e, to be able to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te.
Th@@ ere's e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce that Ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al@@ s, 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ag@@ o, car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with ser@@ i@@ ous ph@@ ys@@ ical in@@ jur@@ y, and per@@ hap@@ s it's because the life experien@@ ce of sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity.
They didn't vie@@ w these people as b@@ ro@@ k@@ en and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ;
they were se@@ en as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ abl@@ e.
A few years ag@@ o, I was in a fo@@ od mark@@ et in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a, and I was st@@ and@@ ing over a bus@@ h@@ el of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es.
It was sum@@ mer@@ tim@@ e: I had sh@@ or@@ ts on.
I h@@ ear this gu@@ y, his vo@@ ice be@@ h@@ ind me say, "@@ Well, if it is@@ n't A@@ im@@ e@@ e Mul@@ lin@@ s@@ ." And I tur@@ n aro@@ un@@ d, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "@@ I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we m@@ et@@ ? I don't re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing you@@ ." He said, "@@ Well, you w@@ oul@@ dn't re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing m@@ e.
I me@@ an, when we me@@ t I was de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ th@@ er@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ."
O@@ h, that gu@@ y.
An@@ d, but of cour@@ se, actu@@ ally, it did cl@@ ic@@ k.
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ th@@ er@@ 's st@@ ori@@ es of that day, bec@@ a@@ us@@ e, of cour@@ se, t@@ y@@ p@@ ical f@@ as@@ hi@@ on, I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my bi@@ r@@ th@@ day by two we@@ e@@ k@@ s.
And so my mo@@ th@@ er@@ 's pre@@ n@@ at@@ al ph@@ ys@@ ici@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation,
so the man who de@@ li@@ ve@@ red me was a compl@@ e@@ te str@@ ang@@ er to my p@@ aren@@ t@@ s.
An@@ d, because I was bor@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ on@@ es, and had fe@@ et tur@@ ned in, and a few to@@ es in this fo@@ o@@ t and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the b@@ ea@@ re@@ r -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the b@@ ea@@ re@@ r of b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s.
He sai@@ d to me, "@@ I had to give this pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is to your p@@ aren@@ ts that you would never w@@ al@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bil@@ ity that other ki@@ ds have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce,
and you@@ 've been ma@@ king li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce@@ ." The ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary thing is that he sai@@ d he had sa@@ ved ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er c@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ing@@ s thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out my wh@@ ole chil@@ d@@ ho@@ o@@ d,
wh@@ e@@ ther w@@ in@@ ning a sec@@ ond gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e, mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ c@@ out@@ s, you know, the H@@ al@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ a@@ de, w@@ in@@ ning my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts v@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ es,
and he was using it, and inte@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing re@@ si@@ dent stu@@ dent@@ s, m@@ ed stu@@ dent@@ s from H@@ a@@ hn@@ em@@ an@@ n M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ ch@@ oo@@ l and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ e@@ dic@@ al S@@ ch@@ o@@ ol@@ .
And he called this part of the cour@@ se the X F@@ act@@ or, the po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al of the human w@@ ill@@ .
N@@ o pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how pow@@ er@@ ful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ al@@ ity of some@@ on@@ e's lif@@ e.
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ ean went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my experien@@ ce, un@@ less re@@ pe@@ ate@@ d@@ ly t@@ old oth@@ er@@ w@@ is@@ e, and even if gi@@ ven a mo@@ dic@@ um of sup@@ por@@ t, if le@@ f@@ t to their own dev@@ ic@@ es, a chil@@ d will ac@@ hi@@ e@@ ve@@ ."
S@@ e@@ e, D@@ r@@ . K@@ ean made that shi@@ f@@ t in thin@@ k@@ ing.
He underst@@ o@@ od that there's a differen@@ ce between the medic@@ al con@@ d@@ iti@@ on and what some@@ one might do with it.
And there's been a shi@@ f@@ t in my thin@@ king over tim@@ e,
in that, if you had as@@ ked me at 1@@ 5 years ol@@ d, if I would have tra@@ ded pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I w@@ oul@@ dn't have h@@ es@@ itat@@ ed for a sec@@ on@@ d.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ al@@ c@@ y back th@@ en@@ .
But if you as@@ k me to@@ day, I'm not so su@@ re.
And it's because of the experien@@ ces I've had with the@@ m, not in sp@@ ite of the experien@@ ces I've had with them.
And per@@ hap@@ s this shi@@ f@@ t in me has happen@@ ed because I've been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have o@@ pen@@ ed do@@ or@@ s for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on m@@ e.
S@@ e@@ e, all you really need is one per@@ son to show you the e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of your own pow@@ er, and you're off@@ .
If you can h@@ and some@@ body the k@@ ey to their own pow@@ er -- the human sp@@ ir@@ it is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and op@@ en a do@@ or for some@@ one at a cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al mom@@ ent, you are educ@@ ating them in the b@@ est sen@@ s@@ e.
Y@@ ou@@ 're te@@ ach@@ ing them to op@@ en do@@ or@@ s for the@@ m@@ sel@@ v@@ es.
In fac@@ t, the ex@@ act me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d "@@ educ@@ ate@@ " com@@ es from the ro@@ o@@ t wor@@ d "@@ e@@ du@@ ce@@ ."
It me@@ ans "@@ to br@@ ing for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to br@@ ing out po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al@@ ."
So again@@ , which po@@ ten@@ ti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing out@@ ?
There was a c@@ ase stu@@ dy d@@ one in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ r@@ it@@ ain@@ , when they were mo@@ ving from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ve sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s.
It's called the st@@ re@@ am@@ ing tri@@ al@@ s. We c@@ all it "@@ tr@@ ac@@ k@@ ing@@ " here in the Stat@@ es.
It's se@@ par@@ ating stu@@ dent@@ s from A@@ , B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.
And the "@@ A stu@@ dent@@ s@@ " get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ r@@ icul@@ um, the b@@ est te@@ ach@@ er@@ s, et@@ c@@ .
Well, they to@@ o@@ k, over a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ io@@ d, D@@ -@@ le@@ ve@@ l stu@@ dent@@ s, ga@@ ve them A@@ '@@ s, t@@ old them they were "@@ A@@ '@@ s@@ ," t@@ old them they were b@@ ri@@ ght,
and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ io@@ d, they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ le@@ vel@@ .
An@@ d, of cour@@ se, the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ k@@ ing, f@@ li@@ p side of this stu@@ d@@ y, is that they to@@ ok the "@@ A stu@@ dent@@ s@@ " and t@@ old them they were "@@ D@@ '@@ s@@ ."
And that's what happen@@ ed at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ io@@ d.
Th@@ ose who were still around in sch@@ o@@ ol@@ , b@@ es@@ ide@@ s the people who had dro@@ p@@ p@@ ed ou@@ t.
A cr@@ uc@@ i@@ al part of this c@@ ase stu@@ dy was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed to@@ o.
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.
They were simpl@@ y t@@ ol@@ d, "@@ Th@@ ese are the '@@ A@@ -@@ stu@@ dent@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ stu@@ dent@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ "
And that's how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.
So, I think that the only tr@@ ue dis@@ abil@@ ity is a cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed sp@@ ir@@ it, a sp@@ ir@@ it that's been cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn't have ho@@ p@@ e,
it doesn't see b@@ ea@@ ut@@ y,
it no l@@ ong@@ er has our natur@@ al, chil@@ d@@ like cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate abil@@ ity to imagin@@ e.
If inst@@ ea@@ d, we can b@@ ol@@ st@@ er a human sp@@ ir@@ it to ke@@ ep ho@@ p@@ e, to see b@@ ea@@ ut@@ y in the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves and oth@@ er@@ s, to be cur@@ i@@ ous and imagin@@ ati@@ ve, then we are tr@@ ul@@ y using our pow@@ er w@@ ell@@ .
When a sp@@ ir@@ it has those qu@@ al@@ iti@@ es, we are able to cre@@ ate new real@@ iti@@ es and new ways of be@@ ing.
I'@@ d like to lea@@ ve you with a po@@ em by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y P@@ er@@ si@@ an po@@ et n@@ am@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ en@@ d, J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me ab@@ ou@@ t,
